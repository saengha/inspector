 * MCPJam is a debugger: pointing it at a broken server is the product
 * working, not an incident. This field exists so a failure that belongs to
 * the user's server or the user's configuration can be shown to them clearly
 * while never paging the MCPJam team, and so the failures that ARE ours stop
 * being lost in that noise.
 *
 * - `user_server`  — we reached the user's server (or its authorization
 *                    server) and it failed, refused, or answered wrongly.
 * - `user_config`  — the inputs we were given are wrong or incomplete: URL,
 *                    credentials, transport, capability toggles.
 * - `mcpjam`       — MCPJam's own code or infrastructure.
 * - `ambiguous`    — the evidence does not settle it. Deliberately distinct
 *                    from `mcpjam`: consumers surface these without paging.
 *
 * Some slugs are genuinely undecidable between the two `user_*` values — a
 * refused port is "nothing is running there" or "wrong port", and the wire
 * cannot tell you which. Nothing downstream depends on separating them:
 * capture policy treats both as never-page, and user-facing copy comes from
 * this entry's own `oneLine` / `likelyCauses` / `nextSteps`, which already
 * state the ambiguity in words. Do NOT write user-facing prose off `origin`.
