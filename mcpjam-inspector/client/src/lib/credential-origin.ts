/**
 * Will saving this URL throw away the server's stored credentials? (MJ-003)
 *
 * The backend clears a row's saved headers, env, OAuth tokens and client secret
 * when a `url` change crosses their origin, because otherwise anyone who can
 * edit a project can repoint a server and have the Inspector deliver somebody
 * else's credential to a host they control.
 *
 * That is the right behaviour and a genuinely surprising one — it destroys data
 * the person saving may not have entered and cannot see. So the edit form has
 * to say so before the save, which is what this is for.
 *
 * ORIGIN, NOT URL. Editing `…/mcp` to `…/mcp/v2` keeps the credentials, and the
 * warning must not fire for it: a warning on the common harmless edit is one
 * people learn to click through, and then it is not there when it matters.
 *
 * These rules mirror `server/utils/secret-origin-binding.ts` and, through it,
 * `convex/lib/canonicalUrl.ts` in the backend. A copy rather than an import
 * because the renderer cannot import server code. If the rules diverge, this
 * warns about the wrong saves — either crying wolf, or staying silent while the
 * backend wipes a credential.
