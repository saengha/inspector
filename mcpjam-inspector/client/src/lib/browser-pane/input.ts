/**
 * Batch a person's gestures and get them onto the wire without waiting.

 * everything else queued behind it. That was the right shape for HTTP, where N
 * concurrent requests arrive in whatever order the network felt like and an
 * out-of-order drag lands somewhere nobody aimed — but the cost was a full
 * round trip of latency added to every gesture after the first, on a path
 * where the round trip is the thing being complained about.
 *
 * A WebSocket is ORDERED, so the ordering the queue was buying is free. What
 * remains worth doing on the client is batching: a drag fires a `mousemove`
 * per animation frame and there is no point sending each one as its own
 * message. So gestures accumulate for one frame and go together, EXCEPT the
 * ones a person can feel — a button or key transition flushes immediately,
 * because a click that waits for the next frame is a click that feels late.
 *
 * Ordering is still enforced BEHIND the socket (`browser-pane-input-forwarder`
 * on the relay keeps one dispatch in flight to the daemon), which is where it
 * has to live: the hop that can reorder is the one that must not.
 *
 * A queue is also a way to send input under a permission that has since gone.
 * `cancel()` is what the pane calls when the lease is handed back or the
 * project changes: whatever is still queued belonged to the hold that just
 * ended, and delivering it afterwards types into somebody else's page.
