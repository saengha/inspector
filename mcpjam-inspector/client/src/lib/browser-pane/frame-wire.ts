 * envelope: a third more bytes on the wire, a `JSON.parse` of a quarter-megabyte
 * string on the main thread per paint, and a `data:` URL the browser had to
 * re-parse into an image. The bytes the daemon already produced are the same
 * bytes, and `createImageBitmap` decodes them off the main thread.
 *
 * The DECODER is the daemon's own (`shared/browserd-frame-stream.ts`), not a
 * second implementation of it. A chunk-safe byte reader that has lost its place
 * in a stream can never find it again, and the failure mode of two copies is
 * not a compile error — it is a pane that goes permanently blank on a boundary
 * neither author thought about.
