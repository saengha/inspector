/**
 * The address field's state, as a value rather than as three `useState`s.
 *
 * It looks like the simplest control in the shell and it is the one with the
 * most ways to be subtly wrong, because it has two sources of truth that
 * disagree constantly. The BROWSER says where the page is, and it says so
 * several times a second: a redirect chain settles, an SPA rewrites the URL
 * with `pushState`, a heartbeat reconciles, the agent navigates. The PERSON
 * says where they want to go, one keystroke at a time. A field that let the
 * first overwrite the second deletes what somebody is typing — and it does it
 * mid-word, on a page that happens to be busy, which is the most infuriating
 * possible version of the bug.
 *
 * So the rule is: while the field is being EDITED, the browser's updates are
 * recorded and not shown. The draft wins until the person commits it (Enter)
 * or abandons it (Escape, or blurring), and only then does the field snap back
 * to whatever the browser has been saying in the meantime.
 *
 * The at-rest / focused split is a separate axis and a deliberate one. At rest
 * the field shows the HOST, because it is a wide element on a screen somebody
 * else can be standing next to and a path carries reset tokens, share links
 * and account ids. Focusing reveals the whole URL — an act by the person who
 * owns the screen, not something that happens because a page loaded.
 *
 * Pure, so every one of those interleavings is a test rather than a thing to
 * try by hand.
