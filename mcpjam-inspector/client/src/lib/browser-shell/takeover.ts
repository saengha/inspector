/**
 * Taking the browser by using it, once, without racing anybody.
 *
 * The old shape was a BUTTON: "Take control", then click. That is honest about
 * the lease and wrong about what people expect from a browser — Codex's has no
 * such button, and neither does any browser anybody has used. The new shape is
 * that a click, a keystroke, a scroll or a navigation takes the browser as a
 * side effect of being those things.
 *
 * Which turns one gesture into a small distributed problem, because acquiring
 * is a round trip and gestures do not wait for round trips. Three things go
 * wrong without a coordinator, and each is worse than the button was:
 *
 *   1. A BURST OF ACQUIRES. A person clicks into the page and immediately
 *      drags; a scroll is a dozen wheel events. Each would start its own
 *      acquire, and the server would see a dozen requests for a lease it has
 *      already granted.
 *   2. THE INITIATING GESTURE LOST, or delivered twice. The click that took
 *      the browser is the one the person meant; dropping it makes them click
 *      again, and delivering it from two paths clicks twice.
 *   3. THE GESTURE DELIVERED INTO A DIFFERENT PAGE. The acquire takes a
 *      moment, the page finishes loading in it, and a coordinate decided from
 *      the old screenshot lands on whatever moved into that rectangle.
 *
 * So: one acquire at a time, the initiating gesture held and delivered exactly
 * once, and only if the page it was aimed at is still there. Everything that
 * arrives DURING an acquire is dropped rather than queued — a queue would
 * replay half a drag into a page that has since scrolled, and the person's
 * hand is still on the mouse.
