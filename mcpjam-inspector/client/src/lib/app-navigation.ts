/**
 * Centralized navigation API for the inspector app.
 *
 * Central wrapper around React Router's navigate/location primitives.
 *
 * URLs are path-based (`/servers`, `/organizations/:orgId/billing`, etc.)
 * matching `react-router` semantics. Scenario session hashes
 * (`#scenario-slug`) are NOT app navigation and are preserved verbatim.
 *
 * ## Logical paths in, scoped paths out
 *
 * `routePaths` and every `build*Path` helper stay LOGICAL — project-relative,
 * with no `/p/<projectId>` in them. One conversion happens at the navigation
 * boundary (`useAppNavigate`, `navigateApp`): a `scope: "project"` target
 * navigated from inside a project keeps that project in the URL. That is the
 * whole trick — callers never think about the prefix, and the prefix never
 * gets lost, because there is exactly one place that adds it and one place
 * (`stripProjectFromPath`) that takes it off before a path is matched against
 * the logical route table.
