/**
 * "What happened" for the one stage a reader selected, on ONE TRIAL.
 *
 * The per-trial sibling of `StageDetailCard`. Same frame — the eyebrow, the
 * stage label, the contract's question — and a different body, because the two
 * cards answer different questions about different populations:
 *
 *   - `StageDetailCard` explains a RUN's stage: three rates over a population,
 *     a reason histogram, exclusion counts.
 *   - this explains a TRIAL's stage: one state, one reason, that row's own
 *     evidence.
 *
 * ── What is deliberately absent ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * No `RateCell`. A rate needs a denominator and one trial is not a population;
 * "100% (1/1)" would be a statistic manufactured from a single observation.
 * No latency: it is deliberately NOT a field on `StageResultRow` (see the
 * stage-measurements contract), and inventing one from elsewhere would attach
 * a timing claim to a row that never carried it. No findings slot: a trial IS
 * the finding, so there is nothing to fill it with.
 *
 * ── Nothing here diagnoses ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The state, the reason and the evidence are read off the row. `nextAction` is
 * the contract's own field, passed in by the caller that holds the diagnostic
 * — never recomputed here from a failure category, because the wording that
 * handles a verdict/chain disagreement is decided by logic this component
 * cannot see.
