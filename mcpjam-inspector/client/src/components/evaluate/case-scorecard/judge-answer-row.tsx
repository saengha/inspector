/**
 * "Did it accomplish the goal?" — in a sentence, with its score and its role.
 *
 * This is the first grader a case has, and on the observe-first flow it is the
 * only one until a run produces evidence to harden from. So it says what it
 * decided in words, and it says what that decides: an advisory judge does NOT
 * move the trial's verdict, and the header keeps saying what the checks said.
 *
 * The honest states matter as much as the answer. A quick run can never be
 * judged — every judge surface is keyed by `suiteRunId`, and a quick run has
 * none — so rather than showing "not run" and letting a reader conclude the
 * judge is broken, it names the reason and points at the control that works.
