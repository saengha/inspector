 * Which authored inputs describe the trial on screen.
 *
 * THE MISTAKE THIS PREVENTS. The left pane always shows the DRAFT — what the
 * case says right now. The right pane shows a TRIAL — what some past run
 * actually graded. Feeding the draft to both is right only while they agree;
 * the moment an author edits a check, the scorecard would start attributing
 * today's scorers to yesterday's run, and rows would join nothing while
 * claiming to describe it.
 *
 * So: when the selected trial still matches the draft, both panes read the
 * same inputs and are identical by construction. When it does not — an edit
 * since the run, or an explicit History pick — the rows come from the
 * iteration's own frozen snapshot instead.
 *
 * WHAT THE SNAPSHOT CANNOT SAY. `testCaseSnapshot.predicates` is the RESOLVED
 * list: suite defaults and case overrides already merged, with no marker for
 * which was which, and `run.configSnapshot` carries no `defaultPredicates` to
 * reconstruct it from. Matching them against the live suite would be a guess
 * that goes wrong exactly when the suite has changed — which is the case a
 * reader opened History to investigate. Those rows are therefore labelled
 * "Run snapshot" and claim no provenance at all.
