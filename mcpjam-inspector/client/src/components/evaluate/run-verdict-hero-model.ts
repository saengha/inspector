/**
 * The verdict, the one sentence under it, and the numbers beside it.
 *
 * The page this replaces said "67%" in three places and never said which case
 * broke. The ordering here is the fix: a reader gets the DECISION first, then
 * one sentence naming the case and where its chain stopped, and only then the
 * measurements. A percentage is a measurement, so it sits with the other
 * measurements and never becomes the headline.
 *
 * ── What this module may and may not do ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It reads a `EvalRunDecisionSummary` and renders it. It does not decide
 * anything: the verdict word comes from `summary.verdict`, the counts from
 * `summary.counts`, and the failing case from `diagnostics` — all of which the
 * contract already settled server-side. There is no arithmetic here that could
 * disagree with the decision it is describing.
 *
 * The one judgement it makes is WHICH diagnostic to lead with, and that is a
 * choice of what to show first, never a claim that the chosen one is the cause.
 * The sentence says "broke at <stage>" because a first failed stage is where
 * the chain stopped; it is not a diagnosis and must never be phrased as one.
