/**
 * Honest header for a REOPENED conversation whose composer does not describe
 * it.
 *
 * The Playground's host, environment and tool controls are ambient per-project
 * browser state, so a conversation opened by `?conversation=<id>` renders under
 * the viewer's current selection. Left unlabelled that reads as a statement
 * about the conversation, and a reply typed under it silently runs on a target
 * the transcript never used.
 *
 * Two things are said here, and nothing is invented:
 *
 *   - `unrecorded` — the conversation stored no execution target, so we say so
 *     rather than dressing the ambient selection up as history.
 *   - `mismatch` — it DID store one and it is not the one selected, so we name
 *     the recorded id and say a reply goes elsewhere.
 *
 * `onAcknowledge` is what un-gates the composer. Continuing on a different
 * target is legitimate — that is why this is a one-click acknowledgement and
 * not a refusal — but it has to be the user's deliberate act, which is exactly
 * what "silently ran on the wrong host" was missing.
