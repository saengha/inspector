/**
 * The browser, beside chat.
 *
 * It used to be the third tab of the right rail, in a 30%-wide column, behind
 * Logs. Three things were wrong with that and only one of them was the width.
 * A page rendered at 30% of a workspace is a page in its mobile layout, so an
 * agent testing a desktop app was testing the phone version of it. Switching
 * to the logs hid the browser, which is the moment you most want to see what
 * the agent just did. And the browser's visibility was decided by a rail whose
 * other two tabs are text.
 *
 * So it is its own panel now, and the rail keeps Logs and Shell. What did NOT
 * move is the engine choice: which body goes here still follows the project's
 * selected computer engine, exactly as the rail's tab did, so a person who
 * picked "This machine" sees the local body whether or not they have
 * authorized it yet.

 * Should the Playground offer a browser panel at all?

 * The same question the rail's Browser tab already answered, kept in one place
 * now that two components ask it. A host without the `browser` built-in has no
 * browser for the model to drive, so a panel would be a promise the host
 * config does not keep — except that an outside agent can open one through
 * `mcpjam browser open` without the host carrying the built-in at all, and
 * hiding the panel then would mean the browser somebody is driving is visible
 * in no window in this app.
 *
 * The hosted body additionally needs a signed-in user: every one of its calls
 * carries a minted browser token, so before authentication is ready it can
 * only fail — into an "unreachable" state with nothing to retry it once auth
 * arrives.
