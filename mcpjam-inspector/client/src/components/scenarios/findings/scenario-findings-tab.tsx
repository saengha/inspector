/**
 * The Findings tab on `/user-testing/:scenarioId`.
 *
 * Same page as the swarm's, fed by a different derivation: personas here are
 * sentiments rather than authored people, so it reuses the summary card,
 * persona strip and persona card and swaps only what the surface disagrees
 * about.
 *
 * Two deliberate differences from the swarm tab:
 *
 *  - The persona badge is a session count, not a sentiment pill. The tab title
 *    already names the feeling, so the pill would only repeat it.
 *  - It reads sessions through the goal-outcome drill-down with User Testing's
 *    hide-synthetic policy applied, because that is the population Insights
 *    counts. Reading without it would report a different total for the same
 *    study, which is exactly what BB-145 asks us not to do.
 *
 * The grid is built from one page of sessions. Beyond that page the card
 * footnotes its own coverage rather than presenting a subset as the whole.
