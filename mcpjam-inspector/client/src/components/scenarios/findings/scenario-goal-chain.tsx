/**
 * The per-goal user value chain, fetched for the ONE goal that is open.
 *
 * Renders nothing. It exists to own a subscription whose answer the tab needs
 * ABOVE it — the same shape as `SuiteRunStageFunnelAvailability`, and for the
 * same reason: `useQuery` throws, an `ErrorBoundary` only catches what its
 * DESCENDANTS throw, and a query that took the Findings tab down with it would
 * be worse than the unmeasured chain it exists to replace.
 *
 * ── Why one goal and not all of them ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Each funnel is an indexed scan of up to `STAGE_SUMMARY_SCAN_LIMIT` rows.
 * Subscribing every goal in the study on tab open would buy a scan per cluster
 * to paint rows the reader has not asked about — the collapsed row shows a
 * session count and an outcome pill, neither of which comes from the chain. So
 * the cost is paid on expand, by the person who asked.
 *
 * ── What a failure means here ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Any throw reports `null`, and `null` leaves the chain unmeasured, which is
 * what the tab already shows today. That is a real fallback, not a swallowed
 * error: the boundary still reports to telemetry, because the two shapes
 * `isConvexQueryUnavailable` forgives do NOT cover this one. A backend that
 * lost the `clusterId` argument is a rollback, and it should page someone.
