/**
 * Maps User Testing window data into the Findings model the swarm tab already
 * renders (BB-145). Pure: no queries, no LLM lanes.
 *
 * The two surfaces disagree about what a "persona" is, and that disagreement is
 * the whole reason this module exists. A swarm persona is authored: we wrote
 * Maya, gave her goals, and stamped every session with her name. User Testing
 * has real visitors who were never assigned anything, and the visitor facets we
 * do hold (new/returning, guest/signed-in, device) do not discriminate on a
 * surface whose sessions all arrive through one shared link.
 *
 * So a User Testing persona is a SENTIMENT: how the user came across. That is
 * the closed five-value `sentiment` on each session, not the emergent sentiment
 * CLUSTER — cluster labels are regenerated on every analysis, so tabs built on
 * them would rename themselves between runs.
 *
 * Honesty rules carry over from the swarm derivation:
 *  - `unclear` is a verdict (the model looked and could not tell) and earns a
 *    persona. An ABSENT sentiment is not a verdict, it is an unanalyzed
 *    session, so it is counted separately and never folded into `unclear`.
 *  - The six-stage chain is not populated here, and not because it is
 *    unreachable — `getScenarioStageFunnel` narrows to a goal cluster now. It
 *    is fetched per OPEN goal instead (`scenario-goal-chain.tsx`), because this
 *    module is pure and the chain is a subscription. Every stage this module
 *    writes is therefore `none`, which renders as "no finding", never a pass.
