 * Edit / Open preview / Share. Edit (`/user-testing/:id/edit`) wears the same
 * action row and holds Settings — environment, sharing permissions, ratings,
 * grading — beside a docked live Preview. Only the back link differs: Edit is
 * a sub-route, so it returns to the scenario rather than out to the list.
 *
 * Preview embeds the share link, so opening Edit starts a REAL guest session —
 * it shows up in Sessions. The embed tags itself `?surface=preview` so that
 * session is labelled.
 *
 * Insights are per-scenario — `ScenarioUsagePanel` is scenario-scoped. There is
 * deliberately no project-wide insights view: aggregating across scenarios that
 * point at different servers would produce themes nobody can act on.
