/**
 * The per-goal user value chain: the probe, and the tab that paints it.
 *
 * Run against a FIXTURE funnel rather than a deployment. The backend argument
 * this consumes (mcpjam-backend#1294) is not deployed yet, so these tests are
 * how the wiring is held to its contract in the meantime — and they stay the
 * cheaper check afterwards.
 *
 * The behaviours worth pinning are the ones that are invisible when they go
 * wrong:
 *
 *  - A failed query leaves the chain UNMEASURED and still reports. Falling
 *    back is not the same as swallowing: a backend that lost `clusterId` is a
 *    rollback, and a tab that quietly rendered "no finding" through it would
 *    look exactly like a healthy study with nothing to say.
 *  - An answer for a goal the reader has closed never paints the goal they
 *    opened next.
 *  - `undefined` is loading, not an answer.
