/**
 * Workbench-level wiring for session-flow selection, on the User Testing scope.
 *
 * Pins the regression the per-component tests could not see: the breakdown
 * query that RENDERS the flow must never receive the flow's own selection
 * chips. Those chips are the diagram's output — feeding them back re-runs the
 * scan filtered to the clicked node, which collapses the diagram to the single
 * path that was selected. The drill-down and the session list are the opposite:
 * narrowing to the selection is their entire job, so they must keep the full
 * filter. Only a test that renders the panel (where the two filters diverge)
 * can observe the difference, which is why this file exists alongside 50-odd
 * green component tests that missed it.
 *
 * The flow itself is stubbed down to the two callbacks the real component
 * fires. Driving it through recharts' SVG would test recharts' layout, not the
 * panel's filter plumbing, and jsdom gives ResponsiveContainer no dimensions to
 * lay anything out in.
