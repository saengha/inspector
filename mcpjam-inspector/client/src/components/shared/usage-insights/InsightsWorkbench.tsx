 * drill-down beside the flow chart. Everything surface-specific arrives as a
 * prop — the scope the queries read, the slots the rail renders, the filter
 * policy, the empty state, and the testid prefix.
 *
 * This replaces two panels that had drifted into ~250 lines of duplicated
 * shell against the same hooks. Where the two disagreed, the reconciliations
 * are deliberate:
 *
 *  - The drill-down is ALWAYS MOUNTED and hidden when closed (the User Testing
 *    contract, pinned by its flow-selection suite): closing toggles the
 *    query's `enabled` rather than unmounting the component, so reopening does
 *    not refetch from scratch. Swarm adopts it.
 *  - The drill-down receives `flow.effectiveFilter`, not `flow.filter`, so a
 *    force-applied chip (hide-synthetic) narrows the drill-down too. Swarm's
 *    version passed the raw filter, which on a surface with an augment would
 *    have shown rows the list beside it excludes.
 *  - Only the fill-viewport layout survives. The scroll-area path had no
 *    production caller. The Findings rail and Run insights banner are their
 *    own sections above the session flow (not chip popovers).
 *  - A topic-map dot click clears the filter on BOTH surfaces before opening
 *    the session: an active cluster chip can otherwise hide the very session
 *    the click asked for.
