/**
 * Numbered progress stepper for multi-step flows.
 *
 * Shared rather than inlined in the Swarm create flow (BB-124): Swarm's four
 * steps are the first user, but the shape — numbered pill, label, connector,
 * one current step — is the same wherever a flow needs to say "you are here".
 *
 * PURE PRESENTATION. It derives each step's state from `activeIndex` and owns
 * no routing: the caller decides which earlier steps are safe to return to.
 * That split matters because "already visited" is not the same as "safe to
 * revisit" — Swarm can't rewind past a launch without re-running it.
 *
 * `Done` is deliberately not a step. A flow's terminal state is a state of the
 * last step, not a fifth circle that can never be current — which is what
 * `activeComplete` expresses.
