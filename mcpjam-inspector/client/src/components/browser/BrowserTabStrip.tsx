/**
 * The tabs, as tabs.
 *
 * The old strip was read-only labels showing each tab's HOST, drawn only when
 * there were two or more, because switching tabs was the model's to do and a
 * clickable strip would have been a second, quieter path into the lease's
 * state machine. That reasoning was right while taking control was a button.
 * It stops being right the moment using the browser IS taking it: a strip you
 * cannot click is not a browser, and the thing it was protecting — one driver
 * at a time — is now enforced by the click itself acquiring the lease.
 *
 * So: titles, favicons, close buttons, a new-tab button, and one tab is still
 * a strip. A browser that grows its tab bar when you open a second tab makes
 * the page jump under the pointer at the exact moment somebody is aiming at
 * something.
 *
 * THE TITLE, NOT THE URL, with the host only as the fallback. The old strip
 * showed the host to keep reset tokens and share links off a screen somebody
 * else can see, and that concern is real — it is why the address field still
 * shows the host at rest. A title is not a URL and carries none of that; it is
 * also what every browser shows and what a person scans for.
