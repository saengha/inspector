/**
 * The agent's browser, as the browser — not a picture of it.
 *
 * On the desktop app the page is a `WebContentsView` running in this very
 * process, so the JPEG path is a round trip through encode, base64, parse,
 * decode and paint to show somebody a page their own machine already has.
 * Here the main process parents that view into the app's own window at this
 * pane's bounds, and what the person looks at IS Chromium: no encoder, no
 * socket, no decode, and input latency that is a repaint rather than a round
 * trip.
 *
 * ── What this component does NOT have ────────────────────────────────────
 * No `<img>`, no `<canvas>`, no pointer handlers and no keyboard handlers.
 * The view is a real browser; it takes its own input from the OS, which is the
 * whole reason the latency goes away. So this file renders the CONTROL BAR
 * (shared with every other engine, from `PaneControlBar`) and a measured empty
 * slot the view is placed over — the pane's job is to say where, not to draw.
 *
 * ── Why the empty slot still matters ─────────────────────────────────────
 * A `WebContentsView` is a sibling of the renderer, not a DOM node in it: it
 * paints OVER whatever the app draws in that rectangle, and it does not scroll,
 * clip or z-index with the page. So the slot has to be measured continuously
 * (a rail drag, a window resize, a sidebar toggle) and the view has to be taken
 * back out the moment this pane stops being the visible tab — otherwise a live
 * browser sits over the app's UI while somebody is reading their logs.
 *
 * ── The lease is still the daemon's ──────────────────────────────────────
 * `visible: true` is a REQUEST. The main process asks the surface, and the
 * surface answers to the daemon's lease — the same authority that refuses the
 * model's commands. A view held by somebody else is hidden rather than merely
 * deafened, because a visible native view of a page another person is typing
 * their password into is an observation.
