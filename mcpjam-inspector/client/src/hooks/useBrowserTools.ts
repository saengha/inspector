/**
 * What the agent browser adds to a turn, for the surfaces that show a host's
 * tools: the six `browser_*` tools MCPJam gives the model, and the WebMCP
 * tools the page it currently has open offers.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The Tools pane lists what a host can do, and the browser
 * capability was invisible in it — a host with `browser` attached showed "No
 * server connected yet" while the model was driving a real Chromium. The
 * tools are built at turn time inside a chat request, so no store or Convex
 * row holds them; asking the server for the definitions is the only way to
 * show them without keeping a hand-written copy that drifts.
 *
 * ENGINE-BLIND TO THE CALLER. Which browser this is (the member's cloud
 * computer or the Chromium on their own machine) changes the transport and one
 * sentence of the tool descriptions, and nothing else — so the caller passes a
 * project and a host config, and reads one answer.
