/**
 * GitHub Checks settings — data layer.
 *
 * **There is no client-side feature flag on this surface.** Availability is
 * decided by the backend and read through
 * `getGithubChecksSettingsAvailability`. That matters: the flag is evaluated
 * server-side against the org, and a client-side twin could disagree with it —
 * showing a page whose every write the server then refuses. One authority,
 * asked once.
 *
 * Function ids are strings because this app has no generated Convex client;
 * types below are hand-mirrored from `convex/github/checkRepoConfigs.ts`. Keep
 * them in sync by hand — nothing checks this at build time.
 *
 * **These hooks can throw, and every call site MUST sit inside an
 * `ErrorBoundary`.** `useQuery` re-throws query errors during render, and
 * ordinary cases produce one here: the backend function is not deployed yet
 * (the two repos release independently), or a caller is not a member of the org
 * they passed — the backend throws there deliberately, because answering
 * `disabled` would confirm the org exists. Guests never ask: GitHub Checks is
 * member-only, so the availability read is skipped when there is no WorkOS
 * user even though the guest session is Convex-authenticated.
 *
 * The boundary is not optional and not defence in depth: a call in a component
 * that is not itself inside one takes that component's whole page down. That is
 * not hypothetical — the suite settings sheet shipped an unguarded call and
 * crashed `/evals` for every user the backend refused. Call sites:
 * `IntegrationsRoute`, `GithubChecksRoute`, and
 * `SuiteGithubChecksSettingsSection` in `suite-iterations-view`.
 *
 * A membership refusal arrives as a `ConvexError` tagged `kind: 'forbidden'`,
 * which `reportCaught` drops. The not-yet-deployed case stays a plain throw and
 * still reports, which is also right: that one means the two repos drifted.
