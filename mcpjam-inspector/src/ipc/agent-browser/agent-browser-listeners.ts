/**
 * The privileged half of "show the agent's browser in the rail".
 *
 * ── Why this channel exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * On the desktop app the agent's browser is a real `WebContentsView` in this
 * process. Sending it to the pane as JPEGs over a socket — encode, base64,
 * parse, decode, paint — is a round trip through three format changes to show
 * somebody a page their own machine already has. Parenting the view into the
 * app's own window at the rail's bounds skips all of it: no encoder, no socket,
 * and input latency that is a repaint rather than a round trip.
 *
 * Only the MAIN PROCESS can reparent a view, so the renderer has to ask. What
 * it may say is deliberately tiny: a boot id, a holder name, whether it wants
 * the view on screen, and a rectangle. It cannot name a window, a `webContents`
 * or a partition, so the worst a compromised renderer can do through here is
 * put the agent's own browser in the wrong place in the app's own window.
 *
 * ── What this handler is NOT ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It is not the input gate. `visible: true` is a REQUEST; the surface answers
 * to the daemon's lease (`daemon/lease.ts`'s `onChange`), which is the same
 * authority that already refuses the model's commands. A renderer that asks to
 * be shown while somebody else holds the browser is refused here and told so —
 * a client-side gate is not a gate, and this is the client's side of it.
 *
 * The sender-identity check is the same one `local-harness-listeners.ts` uses,
 * and for the same reason: an IPC channel that moves a live browser view into
 * the app's window is exactly the kind a stray webview must not reach.
