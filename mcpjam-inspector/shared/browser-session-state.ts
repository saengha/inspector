/**
 * What the browser IS, as one value every surface agrees on.
 *
 * Before this, "what is open" had three answers and none of them was
 * authoritative. The hosted pane read a `{id, url}` list off the frame
 * heartbeat — an 8 KiB budget shared with the encoder's counters, so a session
 * with a dozen tabs simply lost the tail. The local pane read nothing at all,
 * because its stream carries frames and never carried metadata. Electron had
 * no frame socket to read from in the first place: its picture is a real
 * `WebContentsView` and there is no stream between the view and the window.
 *
 * Three engines, three different amounts of truth, and a tab strip that could
 * only ever show the intersection. So the state moves here: one shape,
 * published deliberately rather than inferred from whatever a transport
 * happened to carry, and delivered explicitly on every engine — including the
 * two that had no path for it.
 *
 * TWO WAYS IN, and both are necessary. Browser EVENTS publish a change the
 * moment it happens, which is what makes a tab title appear when the page sets
 * it rather than a second later. A periodic SNAPSHOT reconciles: an event can
 * be dropped by a reconnect, arrive out of order behind a slow relay, or
 * describe a tab that closed while it was in flight, and a pane that only ever
 * applied deltas would drift and never recover. The reducer below takes both
 * and the snapshot always wins.
 *
 * Pure data and pure functions. The transports differ per engine and this
 * deliberately knows about none of them.
