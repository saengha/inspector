/**
 * What counts as an input event, and how a batch of them collapses.
 *
 * ONE definition, read by four callers that must agree: the pane that produces
 * events, the hosted relay and the local relay that validate them, and (by
 * structural identity) the daemon's own dispatcher. They used to be three
 * copies — `computer-browser-panel.ts`'s `isInputEvent`, `browser-pane/input`'s
 * `coalesceInput`, and the local route's bare `slice` — and the failure mode of
 * three copies is silent: an event type added in one place is dropped by the
 * others with a 200 and no page change, which is indistinguishable from a click
 * that hit a dead area.
 *
 * Deliberately SHAPE-ONLY. What the coordinates mean is the daemon's business
 * (`isPointInViewport` refuses out-of-range points and never clamps); this only
 * refuses to call something an event when it has no type, or a type with none
 * of the fields that type needs.
 *
 * WHY VALIDATION MATTERS BEYOND TIDINESS. The daemon's dispatcher ignores a
 * type it does not recognise, so a batch of nonsense came back 200 having done
 * nothing — and was then counted as REAL USE, which defers the idle sweep on a
 * metered machine. A caller with a valid token could hold a box awake
 * indefinitely without touching the browser at all.
