/**
 * The session viewport: how big the agent's page is, and who decides.
 *
 * Until now the answer was a constant. `BROWSER_AGENT_VIEWPORT` fixed 1024×768
 * and four independent places restated it — the Playwright context, the
 * daemon's bounds check, the tool schema handed to the model, and the X screen
 * a hosted box draws on. A constant is the right shape for an EVAL, where a
 * replay artifact is only comparable against a run at the same size, and the
 * wrong shape for a person who has just dragged the browser panel wider: the
 * page they are looking at is 1600 wide and every coordinate the model reasons
 * about is still clipped at 1023.
 *
 * So the size becomes session state, and this module is the vocabulary for it.
 * Three ideas, and each exists because collapsing it into another one lost
 * something:
 *
 *   1. A POLICY, chosen when the session opens. `followPane` sessions resize
 *      with the panel; `fixed` sessions never do. It is chosen at the door
 *      rather than inferred per resize because "may this session change size"
 *      is a property of what opened it — an interactive Playground chat, or an
 *      unattended eval — and not of whoever happens to be watching.
 *   2. A REVISION, bumped on every accepted change. The DOM hash cannot stand
 *      in for it: a CSS breakpoint crossing at 900px reflows a page from three
 *      columns to one with the identical tag skeleton, so a click decided from
 *      the wide screenshot passes the staleness check and lands on whatever
 *      moved into that rectangle.
 *   3. A NEGOTIATION, before a caller is attached. A client written against
 *      the old contract reads coordinates out of a screenshot it assumes is
 *      1024 wide. Letting it join a session that resizes underneath it is
 *      worse than refusing it, because the failure is a click landing in the
 *      wrong place rather than an error anybody can see.
 *
 * Pure data and pure functions — no I/O, no daemon imports — because `shared/`
 * is what leaves this repository and every layer from the Electron main
 * process to the hosted encoder has to agree on these numbers.
 */

/**
 * Who decides this session's size.
 *
 * `fixed` is the default everywhere it is not explicitly asked for. An
 * existing caller — an eval, a swarm, a CLI run, an SDK consumer pinned to
 * contract v1 — gets exactly the session it got before this module existed,
 * and the one that opts in is the one that asked.
