 * apart — so Sentry resolves an event against whichever bundle it happens to
 * pick and symbolicates client frames onto files from a different build.
 * `dist` is the discriminator Sentry provides for exactly this, and it has to
 * be set on both sides: the SDK that reports and the upload that publishes the
 * maps.
 *
 * One entry per artifact set, not per platform-as-metadata — two builds that
 * are separately compiled need separate names even when their sources match:
 *
 * - `web`          Docker/Railway image, `dist/client`
 * - `npm`          published tarball, `dist/client`
 * - `desktop-mac`  mac installer's embedded-server UI, `dist/client`
 * - `desktop-win`  Windows installer's embedded-server UI, `dist/client`
 * - `electron-mac` mac Electron renderer, `.vite/renderer`
 * - `electron-win` Windows Electron renderer, `.vite/renderer`
 *
 * The mac and Windows jobs each build and upload their own `dist/client` AND
 * their own `.vite/renderer`; collapsing either pair back into one name
 * reintroduces the collision this exists to end. `electron-*` doubles as the
 * `dist` for the Electron MAIN bundle in the `inspector-electron` project,
 * where the same two-platform collision applies.
 *
 * `local` is the default for a build that names no surface (a contributor
 * checkout, or a self-hosted user building from source). Those have no
 * uploaded artifacts, and saying so is better than borrowing another build's.
