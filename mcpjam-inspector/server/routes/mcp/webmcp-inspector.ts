/**
 * webmcp-inspector.ts — a managed browser pointed at a page, so its WebMCP
 * tools can be listed, invoked, and watched:
 *
 *   POST   /api/mcp/webmcp/sessions              open a browser at a URL
 *   GET    /api/mcp/webmcp/sessions/:id          session + current tool set
 *   GET    /api/mcp/webmcp/sessions/:id/events   SSE: session/tools/activity
 *   POST   /api/mcp/webmcp/sessions/:id/command  navigate / invoke / cancel /
 *                                                 stream the viewport
 *   DELETE /api/mcp/webmcp/sessions/:id          close + dispose
 *
 * TWO MOUNTS, one router. Locally it hangs off `/api/mcp/webmcp`, where
 * `/api/mcp/*` is itself local-only. On a hosted replica the same router is
 * mounted at `/api/web/webmcp` (see `routes/web/index.ts`), behind bearer auth
 * and a VERIFIED identity — the difference matters, see `hostedIdentity`.
 *
 * Hosted mode forces `transport: "hosted"` and refuses every local shape
 * explicitly rather than by being unreachable: a hosted replica has no display
 * to open a window on and no `<webview>` to attach to, and saying so with a
 * code the UI can explain beats a 404 on a route the client can plainly see.
 * `WEBMCP_INSPECTOR_ENABLED` is the kill switch in both modes;
 * `webmcpInspectorHostedEnabled()` is the separate hosted-reachability gate;
 * client visibility follows the deployment's local/hosted Browser rollout.
 *
 * The browser opens as a real window on the machine running the inspector: the
 * developer drives their own page directly, and this API is the instrument
 * panel beside it, not a remote control for it.
 *
 * One session shape inverts that. Inside the desktop app the client can mount
 * a real Chromium surface itself and pass its `webContentsId` here; the server
 * then ATTACHES to a browser it did not start, and disposing detaches without
 * destroying anything. The field is optional on purpose — an older server
 * strips it and starts an ordinary in-app session, so a newer client degrades
 * rather than fails.

 * report an invocation id until it has finished, so there is nothing to cancel
 * with and the tool keeps running. Reporting `cancelled` would be a lie about
 * a tool that may still be filling in a form. `unknown` is the true answer,
 * and the client can ask again with the same `invokeId` to find out how it
 * ended.
 *
 * It answers in `WebMcpInvocationOutcome`, the SAME shape the activity stream's
 * `invocation_settled` entry carries, because for a hosted caller this replaces
 * that entry rather than summarizing it — the subscriber may be on another
 * replica, so what is returned here is all the client will ever get. That
 * includes the OUTPUT: chat fulfils a page-tool call from this value and hands
 * it back to the model, and an outcome that says `succeeded` and carries
