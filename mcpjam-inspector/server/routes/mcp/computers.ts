 * Local-computer consent capability routes — /api/mcp/computers/local-consent.

 * Deliberately under /api/mcp, NOT /api/web: the global session middleware
 * protects /api/mcp with the inspector session token, so a random webpage
 * can't drive these cross-origin. On top of that each request must carry a
 * VERIFIED sign-in: `bearerAuthMiddleware` labels an unrecognized bearer
 * `unverified_passthrough`, and `requireVerifiedAuth` rejects exactly that —
 * these routes never forward the bearer to Convex, so without it a bare
 * `Authorization: Bearer whatever` would mint a shell-consent capability.
 * Guests are rejected explicitly; the kill switch 404s everything (and the
 * route is additionally never meaningful hosted, where the flag is forced
 * off).
 *
 * grant  → mints + persists (hash-only) a device capability, returns the
 *          plaintext ONCE. Called only from the explicit Allow action.
 * verify → lets a returning client validate its stored capability.
 * revoke → clears the persisted capability; scoped to the presented token
 *          when one is supplied (a delayed revoke must not sever a newer
 *          grant's rotated capability), unconditional otherwise.
