/**
 * WebMCP Inspector frame stream over a WebSocket
 * (`GET /api/web/webmcp/sessions/:id/frames`).
 *
 * The pixels half of a frame-stream session. Everything else about the
 * session — status, tools, activity, and the commands that drive it — stays on
 * the SSE stream and the HTTP command route; this carries painted frames,
 * as binary, and carries them for exactly the reason SSE could not: a JPEG
 * base64'd into a JSON envelope costs a third more bytes, a `JSON.parse` of a
 * quarter-megabyte string per paint, and a second decode on the way to an
 * `<img>`. At 30fps on loopback that tax is most of the perceived lag.
 *
 * WHY `/api/web/` AND WHY A SUBPROTOCOL. `sessionAuthMiddleware` exempts
 * `/api/web/*`, and a browser cannot put a header on a WS handshake — so a
 * route under `/api/mcp/` would 401 every upgrade, and a query-string token
 * would land in access logs. The token therefore rides
 * `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol`, exactly as the two computer terminals do.
 *
 * TRUST MODEL. The token here is the ORDINARY inspector session token — the
 * same one `addTokenToUrl` already puts on the SSE stream — rather than a
 * single-use nonce like the local terminal's. That is a deliberate difference
 * in kind: the terminal opens an interactive shell, while this views and,
 * after capability negotiation, drives a browser session the same token can
 * already start, drive and close through `/api/mcp/webmcp/*`. Socket input is
 * a write path with the same validation and authority as HTTP input.
 * The gates, in order:
 *   1. Shutdown latch → 4503 (see `shutdownWebMcpFrameSockets`).
 *   2. `WEBMCP_INSPECTOR_ENABLED` → 4503; the route is additionally mounted
 *      only when `!HOSTED_MODE`, so a hosted replica has no path here at all.
 *   3. `Origin` must be present AND allowlisted → else 4401. As with the
 *      terminals, an ABSENT Origin is refused: browsers always send one on a
 *      handshake, so a client without one has no business opening this.
 *   4. A valid session token in the subprotocol → else 4401.
 *   5. A session that exists → else 4404.
 *
 * Wire protocol:
 *   client → server  text JSON {type:"ping"} or {type:"input",seq,events}
 *   server → client  text JSON {type:"capabilities",features:["input"]}
 *   server → client  text JSON {type:"input_ack",seq,dispatched,refused?}
 *   server → client  binary frame   24-byte header + JPEG, see
 *                                   `encodeWebMcpBinaryFrame`
 *   server → client  text JSON {type:"pong"}
 *   server → client  close 4401 unauthorized | 4404 gone | 4503 unavailable
 *
 * No client → server binary. Input is capability-gated for local frame-stream
 * sessions and ordered by the existing relay queue. Other commands remain HTTP.
 * Older servers omit the capability, so clients continue ordered HTTP input.
