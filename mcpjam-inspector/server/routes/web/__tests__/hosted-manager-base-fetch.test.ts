/**
 * MJ-001, the structural half: a hosted manager carries a guarded transport
 * fetch, and the guard actually refuses.
 *
 * WHY BOTH ASSERTIONS. `baseFetch !== undefined` would have passed for any
 * function at all, including `globalThis.fetch` assigned by a refactor that
 * meant to be helpful. So each case also drives the captured fetch at a private
 * address and requires a refusal. A fetch that does not refuse is the bug,
 * whatever the field says.
 *
 * SCOPE. This covers the two factories a test can drive without standing up a
 * route: `createAuthorizedManager` (behind every `/api/web/*` MCP operation,
 * including `/servers/validate`) and `buildReplayManager` (eval replay). The
 * two agent surfaces construct theirs inside streaming route handlers; they are
 * held by `scripts/check-hosted-manager-base-fetch.mjs`, which inspects each
 * construction's own argument list and so cannot be satisfied by guarding one
 * of a file's two managers, nor by a `baseFetch` nested on a single server.
