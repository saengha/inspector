/**
 * No route on `/api/web` may ANSWER a caller who presents no credential,
 * unless it is listed below with a reason.
 *
 * This exists because of MJ-002. `/api/web/audio/transcriptions` shipped with
 * no `bearerAuthMiddleware` mount while its ~25 sibling MCP-operation families
 * had one, and the gap was invisible in review: an exemption expressed as a
 * MISSING line in a file of present ones. Nothing failed when that route was
 * added, and nothing would have failed if a second one were added the same way.
 * This is the test that fails.
 *
 * It is deliberately BEHAVIOURAL — it sends a request and reads the status —
 * rather than asserting that a `.use()` is registered. `/export/server` carries
 * no `.use()` and still refuses, because it forwards the bearer to Convex,
 * which rejects. A structural check on middleware registration would both miss
 * real holes and fire on safe routes.
 *
 * ## What this does and does not prove
 *
 * The invariant is "no route SUCCEEDS without a credential" — no 2xx — which is
 * exactly the MJ-002 shape: that finding was a `200` with a transcript in it.
 *
 * The refusal code IS asserted, against a named exception list: every route
 * must answer 401 or 403 unless `NON_AUTH_REFUSALS` records why it does
 * something else. This suite has no Convex, so a route whose first act is an
 * upstream call fails on that instead of on its bearer check, and one that
 * validates before it authenticates answers 400 on the probe body. Naming those
 * keeps the set this sweep cannot see countable, instead of letting a broken
 * upstream read as a refusal. The narrow, deterministic 401 assertions for the
 * route this finding was about live in `audio-auth.test.ts`, where the bearer
 * middleware is the first thing the request meets.
 *
 * So: for a route named in `NON_AUTH_REFUSALS` this proves only "not a
 * success", not "checks a bearer". For every other route it proves an auth
 * refusal.
 *
 * Be concrete about how much that is worth. Of the routes swept at the time of
 * writing, 95 answer 401 and 6 answer 403 — those are genuinely refusing. Seven
 * answer 5xx because their upstream is absent here and three answer 400 on body
 * validation; those ten are the `NON_AUTH_REFUSALS` entries. Narrowing that gap
 * needs a Convex stub, not a stricter assertion over the same responses.
 *
 * The one thing that must never be silent is a probe that fails to reach its
 * handler; that is asserted separately below.
 *
 * Adding to `PUBLIC_SUCCESS_ROUTES` is a security decision, not a way to make
 * this test pass. Each entry names why an anonymous 2xx is correct there.
