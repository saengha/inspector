/**
 * The Browser panel's video feed, proxied so the desktop's password never
 * reaches the browser.
 *
 * Before this, the panel embedded E2B's own noVNC page and put the stream
 * password in the iframe's query string. That password is not a view
 * credential — the daemon's handoff lease gates model-driven commands, not VNC
 * input, and `view_only` is a flag the client sets on itself — so anyone who
 * read it out of the DOM had full keyboard and mouse on the member's desktop
 * for as long as the stream lived. It was in the URL, so it was also in
 * `document.referrer`, in browser history, and in any logging that records
 * iframe sources.
 *
 * So the inspector speaks RFB itself. It authenticates upstream with the
 * password from the session row, offers the browser security type `None` on a
 * socket the panel's own short-lived token already authenticated, and pipes
 * bytes between them. The credential stays on the replica.
 *
 * Proxying is also what makes the lease REAL for a human viewer. The daemon
 * cannot enforce it over VNC — it never sees those packets — so the filter in
 * `rfb-client-filter.ts` runs here, on every client→server message, and drops
 * anything that reaches the desktop's input queue unless this viewer currently
 * holds the lease. A viewer who strips `view_only`, or who points a raw RFB
 * client at this socket with a valid token, gets a picture and nothing else.
 *
 * VALIDATE-ON-STAGING: the upstream URL shape (`wss://<host:6080>/websockify`)
 * comes from `@e2b/desktop`'s own recipe — `novnc_proxy --vnc localhost:5900
 * --listen 6080 --web /opt/noVNC` in front of `x11vnc -rfbauth ... -shared` —
 * but has not been exercised against a live sandbox. The handshake it performs
 * is unit-tested against the protocol in `utils/computers/rfb-handshake.ts`.
