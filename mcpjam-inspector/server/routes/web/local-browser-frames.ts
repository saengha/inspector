/**
 * The live picture of the local agent browser — `/api/web/computers/local-browser/frames`.
 *
 * The model reads the page through screenshots on its command results. A
 * PERSON needs to watch it move and, when the agent hits a CAPTCHA or an SSO
 * prompt, take over. That is this socket: JPEG frames out, and (through the
 * separate `/local-browser/input` route) their pointer and keys back in.
 *
 * The handshake is the local terminal's, deliberately, down to the close
 * codes: a single-use nonce in `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` (a browser cannot set
 * headers on a WS handshake, and a query string lands in access logs), an
 * Origin that must be present and allowed, and a re-check that the consent
 * capability the nonce was minted against is still the live one — so revoking
 * consent, or re-granting it from another browser profile, invalidates
 * anything already handed out.
 *
 * What it adds over the terminal's: the daemon's LEASE decides who may watch.
 * While a person holds the browser, only they receive frames — a second pane
 * showing someone's password field as they type it is the same leak as an
 * agent screenshotting it, and the lease is the only thing that knows whose
 * hands are on the page.
