/**
 * MCPJam Agent — POST /api/web/mcpjam-agent
 *
 * UI-ONLY chat surface: the agent ACTS exclusively by driving the inspector
 * UI through the client-fulfilled `ui_*` tools, so every action is visible
 * to the user in their own app. It KNOWS things via read-only sources:
 *   - the hosted docs server (`https://docs.mcpjam.com/mcp`, Mintlify) for
 *     how MCPJam itself behaves,
 *   - the MCP project's own docs server (`https://modelcontextprotocol.io/mcp`,
 *     also Mintlify) for what the PROTOCOL says, and
 *   - the `web_search` built-in.
 *
 * Why a second docs server rather than protocol knowledge in the prompt (or
 * a pinned skill): the spec is published per version — `/specification/`
 * holds `2024-11-05`, `2025-03-26`, `2025-06-18`, `2025-11-25`, `2026-07-28`
 * and `draft`, the exact range this debugger targets — and its server
 * exposes a read-only filesystem (`ls`/`cat`/`rg` over the `.mdx` sources)
 * alongside search. That makes retrieval ADDRESSED: the model must name a
 * version to read one, so it cannot silently answer a 2026-07-28 question
 * out of the 2025-03-26 text. Model priors degrade across exactly that range,
 * which is where the wrong answers were coming from.
 *
 * Both docs servers also offer a `submit_feedback` WRITE tool, which this
 * route declines — see `DECLINED_MCP_TOOL_NAMES`.
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT connect the MCPJam platform MCP worker for chat
 * turns any more: those tools mutate the user's workspace (projects,
 * servers, evals, scenarios) server-side and invisibly, which is exactly
 * what this surface is meant not to do. `MCPJAM_AGENT_PLATFORM_TOOLS=1`
 * restores the old ACTION contract wholesale (see
 * `agentPlatformToolsEnabled`). It does not gate the knowledge sources: the
 * kill-switch governs how the agent acts, not what it may read, so the docs
 * servers are connected identically in both modes.
 *
 * The platform CONFIG and the `/widget-content` sub-route below stay: chat
 * sessions from before the cutover still contain platform widget parts, and
 * reloading one re-reads its `ui://` resource through that route. Removing
 * it would break history rendering, not just new turns.
 *
 * The Home page is its first consumer; the side-panel bubble across the
 * rest of the UI hits the same endpoint.
 *
 * Platform worker URL: resolved by environment via `resolvePlatformMcpUrl()`
 * (local/dev → local `wrangler dev` worker, staging/preview → the staging
 * worker, prod → the prod worker). `MCPJAM_PLATFORM_MCP_URL` overrides it.
 *
 * Auth to the platform worker: the worker verifies AuthKit JWTs from the
 * same issuer the inspector authenticates with (prod `login.mcpjam.com`,
 * staging `dynamic-echo-14-staging`), so the caller's bearer is forwarded
 * as the MCP `accessToken`. Local dev tokens come from the dev AuthKit app,
 * which only the LOCAL worker (`wrangler dev --env dev`) trusts — `npm run
 * dev` starts that worker automatically, so the agent talks to it on
 * `http://localhost:8787/mcp`. If the worker is down the preflight below
 * degrades the agent to docs + web_search.
 *
 * Differences vs `/api/web/chat-v2`:
 *   - The agent owns its own `MCPClientManager` hardcoded to these servers.
 *     It does NOT go through `createAuthorizedManager`'s project-server
 *     resolution and does NOT register any of them into any user's project.
 *   - Persists as `sourceType: "direct"` with `hostConfig: null` — the
 *     synthetic `"mcpjam-docs"` / `"mcp-spec"` / `"mcpjam-platform"` ids
 *     would fail backend `selectedServerIds` validation against the
 *     project's `servers` rows. The chat appears in the user's history alongside
 *     other direct sessions; per-surface differentiation is client-side.
 *   - Ignores scenario / appTools / selectedServerIds fields up front — this
 *     surface owns its MCP tool set. The one client-supplied tool snapshot it
 *     DOES accept is `uiTools` (WebMCP UI tools, validated at the boundary):
 *     the agent panel is the primary surface for driving the inspector UI.

// servers. The general hosted endpoint resolves a Convex-registered
// project server; the agent's platform server has no Convex row, so the
// renderer can't route through `buildServerRequest`. This route does the
// same job for the platform server only: open an ephemeral authed MCP
// connection and `resources/read` the `ui://` resource — the widget HTML
// always comes from the server, per MCP Apps.
//
// The client routes here when the tool result's `_serverId` is the
// synthetic platform id (see shared/mcpjam-agent-widgets.ts and
// fetch-widget-content.ts).
