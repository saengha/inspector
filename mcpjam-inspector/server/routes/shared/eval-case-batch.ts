 * `testSuites:createTestCase` once per case, so converting a repo's 40 test
 * files cost 40 sequential round trips and each case's write was its own
 * transaction. One mutation per chunk replaces that.
 *
 * Two things live here rather than at each call site, because three call sites
 * getting them subtly different is the failure this module exists to prevent:
 *
 *   - CHUNKING at the backend's cap. The cap is deliberately smaller than the
 *     suite file's 500-case limit, so a maximal file is expected to upload in
 *     several calls; chunking is normal operation, not an error path.
 *   - MINTING. Callers mint declared ids (`mintCaseId`), Convex validates the
 *     charset and suite-scoped uniqueness and never derives one. A minted `c_`
 *     id is a declared identity and lands in `declaredCaseId`; it is never
 *     written into the random `ui_*` storage `caseKey`.
