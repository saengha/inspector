/**
 * POST /api/v1/projects/:projectId/agent — headless agent turn over the
 * public API.
 *
 * An external caller (first consumer: the MCPJam Slack bot) sends a plain
 * message history; the server runs ONE assistant turn through the shared
 * engine facade (`runUnifiedAssistantTurn`) with a curated set of platform
 * operations as tools, and returns the final assistant text plus references
 * to any resources the turn created. Synchronous JSON — the caller holds
 * conversation state and resends history each turn.
 *
 * RETRY CONTRACT: send `idempotencyKey` — a STABLE identity for the
 * triggering event, not a fresh uuid per attempt (the Slack app sends
 * `${teamId}:${event_id}`). Each WRITE op the turn performs derives its own
 * key from it, so a retried turn re-issues the same mutations onto the same
 * rows instead of authoring duplicate suites. Error responses still carry
 * `details.createdResources` so a caller can see what a failed turn already
 * persisted.
 *
 * The key makes a retry SAFE; it does not make one free. Callers should still
 * dedupe at their own trigger (the Slack app claims each event durably before
 * processing) so most retries never re-run the turn at all — and a retry whose
 * model authors materially different arguments hashes differently and is
 * correctly treated as a different write. Omitting the key preserves the old
 * non-idempotent behaviour rather than being rejected.
 *
 * Surface decisions (see the Slack-app v1 plan):
 *  - Tools are TIERED by what an operation costs. READ ops and non-spending
 *    WRITE ops (`AGENT_API_OPERATIONS`) execute directly. Ops that SPEND —
 *    run suite, run case, generate cases, cancel run
 *    (`AGENT_API_GATED_OPERATIONS`) — are PROPOSAL-ONLY: the tool validates
 *    against the op's real schema, persists a proposal, and returns an opaque
 *    action id; a human click executes it. `approvalMode: "auto-deny"` has no
 *    interactive fallback, so an unattended turn must never spend on the
 *    model's own initiative. Destructive ops stay excluded entirely — a
 *    proposal makes spend deliberate, not a deletion recoverable.
 *  - Every operation is HARD-CLAMPED to the route's `projectId`. The op
 *    catalog's `project` selector allows cross-project roaming for other
 *    surfaces; prompt instructions are not an authorization boundary, so
 *    this adapter overwrites the input and rejects mismatching explicit
 *    values. Org isolation stays enforced by Convex via the delegated JWT.
 *  - The model is pinned server-side (hosted catalog), billed to the
 *    caller's project through the hosted `/stream` rail.
 *  - No chat-session persistence: the caller owns the transcript.
 *  - No tasks seam (the /api/v1 surface refuses task opt-ins by type).
 *
 * Auth plumbing: the caller authenticates with a WorkOS API key (`sk_…`),
 * but BOTH the engine's Convex `/stream` calls and the self-dispatched
 * platform-op calls need a JWT — so the delegated org-scoped JWT minted by
 * `getConvexBearerForRequest` is used for both. Routing the ops through the
 * delegated JWT (not the raw `sk_` key) also keeps the agent's own tool
 * calls out of the caller's per-key rate bucket.
