/**
 * MCPJam Public API — v1 live-MCP surface (Inspector Node).
 *
 * Mounted at `/api/v1`. Resource-oriented, project-scoped routes that wrap the
 * same core helpers as `/api/web/*` (no forked handler logic) and emit the
 * canonical v1 envelope. Covers read diagnostics (validate/doctor/lists),
 * write operations (tools/call, prompts/get, resources/read, OAuth token
 * import, async eval runs — POST creates + detaches; agents poll the GET
 * routes for status, iteration results, and traces), and the catalog reads
 * (me/projects/servers/eval-suites/chat-sessions) proxied over the Convex
 * `/v1/*` surface so this is the ONE public host for the whole API.

// id, a guest token is validated and metered per guest id — but an AuthKit JWT
// is deliberately NOT verified here (every route it fronts forwards the bearer
// to Convex, which verifies it against JWKS), and so reached the handlers with
// nothing attached to it at all. Anyone can present one. It runs AFTER the auth
// middleware because the label that middleware sets is the only thing that
// distinguishes an asserted identity from a verified one.
//
// The `slk_`/`dsc_` SERVICE credentials are unmetered here too, and stay that
// way deliberately: each is a single shared secret compared against a
// server-side hash (`surface-service-auth.ts`), so a caller cannot mint one,
// and the surface it fronts is our own bot rather than the public. Their real
// ceiling is the backend's org-keyed budgets, which no gateway limiter can
// substitute for. If a first-party surface ever needs braking, it wants its own
