/**
 * Workspace grants and local harness consent — the two pieces of local state
 * that decide whether a turn may run on this machine at all.
 *
 * ── Why this is not the existing device consent ───────────────────────────
 * `computers/local-consent.ts` already proves "the human allowed agents to run
 * commands on this machine". That is the right primitive for a discrete,
 * per-command, chat-approved `bash` call. It is the WRONG authorization for a
 * long-lived vendor harness: the two differ in duration, in blast radius, and
 * in what the user was actually shown. Reusing it would silently upgrade a
 * device-level "yes" into "yes, start an agent with a permission profile you
 * never saw, against a runtime you never saw, in a directory you never picked".
 *
 * So local harness execution mints its OWN grant, bound to every identity that
 * changes what the user agreed to (invariant 14): user, machine, project,
 * canonical workspace, harness, target mode, isolation backend, runtime
 * identity, permission profile, and policy version. Change any of them and the
 * binding no longer matches, so the grant is unusable and the user is asked
 * again — which is the honest behavior, not an inconvenience.
 *
 * ── What is persisted ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Only a SHA-256 of the capability token, alongside the binding, at 0600 in an
 * owner-only directory, written atomically. The plaintext lives with the
 * client that minted it. Same shape, and the same honest caveat, as the device
 * consent it sits beside: a process already running as this OS user can edit
 * the file. What this defends is a client — or a remote page, or a script —
 * starting a host agent without a human having deliberately chosen these exact
 * terms.
 *
 * ── Why a path never travels ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A raw host path is not an authorization primitive. Callers name a workspace
 * by an opaque `workspaceGrantId`; only this module, inside the local trusted
 * process, turns that back into a canonical path. A renderer that could submit
 * a path could submit any path.
