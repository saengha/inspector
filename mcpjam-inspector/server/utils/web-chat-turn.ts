/**
 * Shared web-chat streaming turn.
 *
 * Encapsulates the streaming/persistence/provider-branching body that both
 * `web/chat-v2` and `web/mcpjam-agent` share. Extracted verbatim from
 * `web/chat-v2.ts` (commit history) so behavior is identical for the original
 * caller — see `feedback_mechanical_commit_framing` for why this lives in its
 * own commit.
 *
 * The caller is responsible for:
 *   - Parsing the inbound body.
 *   - Constructing the MCPClientManager (`createAuthorizedManager` for
 *     project-server chats, ad-hoc for self-hosted agent surfaces).
 *   - Pre-building the `hostConfig` payload (only direct-chat callers do;
 *     other callers omit it).
 *
 * This helper owns:
 *   - `prepareChatV2` (with the Anthropic-tool-name 400 catch).
 *   - The `isMCPJam` / org-BYOK / local-runtime branch.
 *   - Constructing `onConversationComplete` → `persistChatSessionToConvex`
 *     with optional tool-snapshot capture, gated on `manager.hasServer`.
 *   - `cleanupStream` → `manager.disconnectAllServers()`.
 *   - Throwing/propagating errors; the caller is expected to catch and run
 *     its own OAuth-error enrichment if applicable.

  // unscrubbed resume the fork was introduced to prevent, reached by way of a
