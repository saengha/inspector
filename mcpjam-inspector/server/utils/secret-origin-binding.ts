/**
 * The last gate before a stored credential goes on the wire (MJ-003).
 *
 * A saved server row holds the target `url` and the credentials entered for it.
 * Revealing those credentials is creator-only; changing the `url` needs only
 * workspace role `member`. The backend now clears the credentials when a `url`
 * change crosses their origin, which closes the reported attack — but two gaps
 * survive a write-side fix alone, and this is what covers them:
 *
 *   1. **The authorize/reveal window.** Authorize and reveal are separate round
 *      trips. A `url` flipped between them is read by the first and paid for by
 *      the second, and no write-side gate can see that.
 *   2. **The next writer.** Three code paths patch an existing row's `url`
 *      today. A fourth added later without the gate reopens the finding; this
 *      refuses to attach the credential anyway.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED, INCLUDING ON ABSENCE. A credential-bearing row with no recorded
 * binding is refused, not allowed. "Absent means allow" is the hole the field
 * exists to close, and it is why the backend's `secretsBoundOrigin` backfill
 * gates this deploy: enforcement must not ship until every credential-bearing
 * row is bound, or existing servers stop connecting.
 *
 * The origin rules are a hand-mirror of `convex/lib/canonicalUrl.ts`
 * (`originForCredentialBinding`). They have to agree: a stricter rule here
 * refuses connections the backend considers fine, and a looser one accepts a
 * credential the backend would have cleared. Change one, change both.
