/**
 * The one outbound transport every HOSTED MCP client manager dials through.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `MCPClientManager` resolves its transport fetch as
 * `config.baseFetch ?? this.defaultBaseFetch` and falls back to the global when
 * both are absent, so a manager built without either dials `globalThis.fetch`:
 * no address classification, and redirects followed by the HTTP client with
 * nothing checking where they land. The conformance and readiness lanes have
 * passed a pinned fetch in since the seam existed; the hosted connection
 * factories never did, and every `/api/web/*` MCP operation went out that way.
 * That is pentest finding MJ-001 — a caller stores a server URL, asks us to
 * connect, and reads the answer back out of the response.
 *
 * The guard itself is not new and is not written here. `createStreamingPinnedFetch`
 * resolves once, refuses the disallowed answers, pins the surviving address into
 * the socket, and re-runs all of it on every redirect hop. This module exists so
 * there is ONE place that decides what a hosted MCP connection dials through,
 * rather than six construction sites each deciding it independently — which is
 * how five of them came to decide nothing at all.
 *
 * STREAMING, NOT BUFFERING. `createPinnedFetch` (the sibling) reads the whole
 * body before returning; an MCP session is `text/event-stream` and would break
 * outright. The timeouts below mirror `createConformanceFetch`, for the same
 * reason it gives: an MCP connection is long-lived and a conforming server may
 * legitimately say nothing for a long time, so the deadline that can apply is an
 * idle one, never a total one.
 *
 * A NO-OP OUTSIDE HOSTED MODE. `createStreamingPinnedFetch` returns bare `fetch`
 * when `!HOSTED_MODE`, and `routes/web/**` is mounted on the desktop app too —
 * reaching `http://localhost:3000/mcp` there is the entire product. The gating
 * lives inside the factory rather than at any call site so a local connection
 * cannot be broken by a caller that forgets to ask.
