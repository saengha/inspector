  // RE-INTRODUCE EVERY UNRESOLVED CALL BEFORE ANY ANSWER GOES OUT.
  //
  // This response is a NEW one. The client's reducer looks for a tool part on
  // the message it is currently building, so every chunk below that names a
  // tool call from the PREVIOUS response — `tool-output-denied`, and the
  // results `emitToolResults` writes — needs that call re-introduced first or
  // the client throws `No tool invocation found for tool call ID "…"` and ends
  // the turn with a red banner, after the tools have already run.
  //
  // EVERY unresolved call, not only the approved ones. Two of the three
  // reasons a call is sitting here unresolved are not "it was approved":
  //
  //   - A DENIED call. Its `tool-output-denied` is written below, and nothing
  //     had introduced it.
  //   - A SIBLING that never needed approval. The approval pause is
  //     whole-step: it drains only approval-free meta tools, so an ordinary
  //     tool the model emitted in the same assistant message waits here too —
  //     and `executeToolCallsFromMessages` below runs EVERY unresolved call,
  //     so a result for that sibling is written whether or not anyone approved
  //     anything.
  //
  // A MIXED STEP IS ORDINARY, and does not need two families on two floors to
  // happen: the model emits several calls in one assistant message all the
  // time, an `app_*` or read-only `ui_*` among them never pauses, and one
  // gated call is enough to park every sibling here.
