/**
 * A browser Playground turn must RECORD THE TARGET IT RAN ON.
 *
 * Before this, the direct-chat `resumeConfig` carried seven fields and not one
 * of them said where the turn executed. Reopening a conversation therefore had
 * nothing to restore from, and the client fell back to the viewer's own
 * localStorage selections — a conversation that ran on a Cursor harness in a
 * Project Environment reopened displaying an unrelated host and model, and a
 * follow-up typed into it ran on that unrelated target silently. Only
 * `origin: "api"` sessions (`routes/v1/chat-session-turn.ts`) wrote the pin.
 *
 * These tests lock the persisted PAYLOAD, not the client's restore behaviour:
 * they assert on the `persistChatSessionToConvex` call the turn makes.
