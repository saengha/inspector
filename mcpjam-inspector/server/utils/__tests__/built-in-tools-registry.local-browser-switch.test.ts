/**
 * The local browser's kill switch, read where the tools are ADVERTISED.
 *
 * Its own file because `LOCAL_BROWSER_ENABLED` is resolved once at import
 * time, so flipping it means mocking the config module — and doing that in the
 * main registry suite would impose the mock on sixty tests that do not want
 * it.
 *
 * Why this matters at all: every other layer already honors the switch (the
 * routes 404, `ensureLocalBrowserSession` throws), and that is exactly what
 * made the gap easy to miss. A tool that is advertised and then fails on its
 * first call is worse than one that was never offered — the model spends a
 * turn discovering a capability the operator turned off, and the failure reads
 * as a broken page rather than a closed door.
