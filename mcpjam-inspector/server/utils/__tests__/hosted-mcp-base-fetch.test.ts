/**
 * MJ-001: the guard itself, and the boot assertion that keeps a hosted
 * deployment from starting with its own first-party servers behind it.
 *
 * SCOPE, since three files share this finding's coverage: this one owns
 * `hostedMcpBaseFetch()`'s behaviour — that it refuses, and that it is inert
 * locally. That every hosted FACTORY threads it is
 * `routes/web/__tests__/hosted-manager-base-fetch.test.ts`; that no hosted file
 * can construct a manager without it is
 * `scripts/check-hosted-manager-base-fetch.mjs`, because no runtime test can
 * see a factory that does not exist yet.
