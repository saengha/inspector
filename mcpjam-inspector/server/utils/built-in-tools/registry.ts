/**
 * Host tool resolver: resolved host config → AI SDK ToolSet.
 *
 * THE single construction path from host-config fields to runnable built-in
 * tools, for every engine (chat-v2 routes, eval runners, sessionSimulation,
 * the docs agent). All knowledge of "which config field produces which tool,
 * with which gates" lives here; callers pass what their surface resolved and
 * stop knowing the details:
 *
 *   resolveHostTools({ builtInToolIds, computer }, ctx) → { web_search, bash, … }
 *
 * Two host-config fields feed it:
 *   - `builtInToolIds` — the CAPABILITY list (catalog ids, also the exact AI
 *     SDK tool names the model invokes).
 *   - `computer` — the RESOURCE attachment (a personal cloud workstation).
 *     It produces no tool by itself; computer-backed catalog ids (today:
 *     `bash`) are skipped unless the host carries it.
 *
 * Per-tool gates (all inside this module, by design):
 *   - web_search: requires Convex auth ctx (bills MCPJam credits server-side;
 *     guests are rejected by the Convex route at execute time). Inherits the
 *     host's `requireToolApproval` via ctx, like bash.
 *   - bash: TWO paths. With `ctx.sandboxBinding` (a trusted, in-process-only
 *     binding to an already-provisioned EPHEMERAL sandbox) it binds to that
 *     disposable box and the personal computer is never consulted. Without one
 *     it takes the personal path, which requires Convex auth ctx AND
 *     `computer`. Guests included on the personal path — the backend accepts
 *     guest bearers on /computers/reserve and contains cost via the guest daily
 *     start cap + idle-delete sweep. Inherits the host's `requireToolApproval`
 *     via ctx either way.
 *   - workspace tools (list_project_servers, diagnose_server,
 *     list/call_server_tool(s), prompts, resources — the shared platform
 *     operation catalog, see built-in-tools/mcpjam.ts): require
 *     ctx.mcpjamPlatformClient, the route-injected PlatformApiClient bound
 *     to the caller's bearer; engines that don't pass it never advertise
 *     them. Skipped for guest actors AND scenario sessions — mirrors the
 *     /api/v1 boundary ("Guests cannot access /api/v1"): the workspace
 *     surface is for project members, and the operations authorize via
 *     project membership, not scenario tokens. Connection-opening ops
 *     inherit `requireToolApproval` like bash does.
 *
 * Deliberately thin: this module merges tool sets, it does not absorb
 * per-surface policy. The eval engines simply never pass `computer` (a
 * personal computer is mutable per-user state an eval can't reproduce);
 * there is no isEval flag here and there must never be one.
