/**
 * A page's WebMCP tools, as FIRST-CLASS model tools.
 *
 * The model used to reach a page's tools through two generic verbs: list them
 * with `browser_webmcp_tools`, then call one by name through
 * `browser_webmcp_invoke` with an untyped `input` blob. That was two wasted
 * round trips per page and an argument nobody checks — `input` was
 * `z.unknown()`, Chrome does not validate an invocation against the registered
 * `inputSchema` (WebMCP spec issue #92), and the page's `execute` is handed
 * whatever arrived. On the pizza-maker demo the model's invoke failed twice
 * and it fell back to clicking.
 *
 * The list verb is gone entirely (every observation now reports what the page
 * has); the invoke verb survives only where a turn cannot grow its tool set.
 *
 * Here each page tool is its own tool: real name, the page's own schema
 * advertised verbatim, arguments validated before any command leaves this
 * process, an ordinary approval pill, and a binding that says WHICH
 * registration on WHICH document generation the model is calling.
 *
 * SERVER-EXECUTED, like the `browser_*` verbs and unlike `page_*`/`ui_*`. The
 * distinction is decided solely by `typeof tool.execute === "function"`
 * (`shared/http-tool-calls.ts`), and the `page_`/`ui_`/`app_` prefixes mean
 * "the BROWSER fulfils this". A page can register a tool literally called
 * `page_abcd1234`, so the `webmcp_` prefix is not decoration: a page tool
 * wearing a client-fulfilled name would leave the stream waiting forever on a
 * result nobody sends.
 *
 * TWO THINGS ARE STRUCTURAL:
 *
 *   1. EVERY PAGE TOOL DECLARES `needsApproval`. Every engine reads approval
 *      off the tool object itself (`shared/tool-approval.ts`), and an absent
 *      declaration is FREE — so a `webmcp_*` tool built without one would run
 *      third-party code on a signed-in browser with no pill at all. The value
 *      is the browser capability's interactive floor for this turn: the user's
 *      Tool Approval switch wherever a person can be asked, and the declared
 *      policy where nobody can (an unattended run, gated at execute time by
 *      the tool policy). `mcpjam-stream-handler.test.ts` pins the ungated
 *      behaviour that makes the declaration mandatory.
 *
 *   2. PAGE ANNOTATIONS ARE NEVER READ. A page's `readOnly` is a claim by the
 *      party whose code would run, and Chromium does not carry annotations
 *      through for imperative registrations at all — so `readOnly: false` on
 *      one of those is the absence of a signal, not a claim. The switch is the
 *      only input; the page never gets a vote. See
 *      `pageToolCallNeedsApproval`.
