/**
 * What the agent does while a person is holding the browser.
 *
 * Until now: nothing useful. A command arrived, the daemon refused it with
 * `lease_blocked`, and the tool answered "a person has taken control — wait
 * for them to hand it back, then re-observe". Which is correct advice and a
 * terrible mechanism, because there is no way for a model to wait. It has one
 * move — call a tool — so "wait" becomes a retry, and a person signing in for
 * ninety seconds watches the transcript fill with identical refusals while the
 * run burns tokens on them. Worse, some of those refusals are the last thing
 * in a turn, so the run ends having achieved nothing at the exact moment the
 * person finished clearing the obstacle it was stuck on.
 *
 * So the waiting moves HERE, into the tool call itself. The call parks — it is
 * a promise, and a promise can wait — and comes back when the browser does.
 *
 * WHAT COMES BACK IS NOT THE ORIGINAL COMMAND'S RESULT. The command was never
 * run, and running it now would be replaying a click decided against a page
 * that a person has since logged into, navigated away from, or dismissed a
 * dialog on. That is the same stale-targeting failure `stale_observation`
 * exists to catch, arriving through a door the guard does not watch. Instead
 * the call answers with a fresh observation and says plainly that control came
 * back and the plan needs re-deciding. The model gets to reconsider, which is
 * the only honest thing to do with a page somebody else has been using.
 *
 * Everything here is injected, so the waiting, the polling and the clock are
 * all testable without a browser or a real second of real time.
