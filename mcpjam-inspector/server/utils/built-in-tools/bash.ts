/**
 * `bash` built-in tool — Project Computers data plane (chat surface).
 *
 * `bash` is a computer-backed CATALOG id: it's advertised for a turn only
 * when the host's `builtInToolIds` carries `"bash"` AND the host attaches a
 * `computer` resource — both gates live in `registry.ts`'s
 * `resolveHostTools`, the single construction path for host tools. Guests
 * are included: Convex accepts guest bearers on `/computers/reserve` and
 * contains cost via the guest daily start cap + idle-delete sweep. Same
 * shape pattern as `exa-web-search.ts`: the inspector defines the tool;
 * authorization and durable state live in Convex.
 *
 * The exec pipeline (reserve → sandbox-info → E2B exec → command log) lives
 * in `computers/run-command.ts`, shared with the /api/web/computers/exec
 * route. When THIS server isn't a configured data plane (an OSS
 * contributor's localhost — no vendor key, no secrets), the tool delegates
 * the exec to the deployed inspector named by
 * `COMPUTERS_REMOTE_DATA_PLANE_URL`, forwarding the user's bearer; Convex
 * authorizes it identically either way. See
 * `computers/remote-data-plane.ts`.
 *
 * `execute` returns `{ error }` instead of throwing so the model can relay
 * problems conversationally instead of breaking the turn.
