/**
 * The six `browser_*` built-in tools — a real Chromium on the member's cloud
 * computer, driven through the sandbox-local browserd daemon.
 *
 * SERVER-EXECUTED, like `bash` and unlike the `page_*`/`ui_*` namespaces: the
 * model calls a tool, this server sends a command to the daemon and returns
 * the result. Nothing here is client-fulfilled, so no new namespace enters
 * `isClientFulfilledToolName`; each tool carries its own `needsApproval`, like
 * every other family.
 *
 * TWO THINGS ARE STRUCTURAL, not conventions to remember:
 *
 *   1. FAIL-CLOSED ADVERTISEMENT. `buildBrowserTools` returns nothing unless
 *      the caller ATTESTS how approval reaches the user. Not because anything
 *      has to be threaded back any more — the tools declare their own floors,
 *      and an unthreaded surface would now gate correctly — but because
 *      `approvalDelivery` is the one thing this file cannot work out for
 *      itself: whether A PERSON IS WATCHING. That answer decides the browser's
 *      context mode (a persistent, signed-in profile or a blank ephemeral
 *      one), the owner key, and whether an unattended run's policy is
 *      mandatory. A surface that has not said which kind of run it is has not
 *      chosen any of those, and defaulting them is how an eval comes to run
 *      against whatever profile the last playground session left signed in.
 *
 *   2. A SCREENSHOT REACHES THE MODEL AS AN IMAGE, via `toModelOutput`. The
 *      implementation result carries the capture as base64 in an ordinary
 *      field; left there it is serialized into the tool result as TEXT, which
 *      no provider can see. Every one of these tools targets by coordinates
 *      read off that image, so without the mapping the whole coordinate design
 *      is a blind guess — and the turn pays tens of thousands of tokens for a
 *      string the model cannot read. `browser-session-context.ts` states the
 *      same requirement, and `computer-use-tool.ts` is the sibling that
 *      already meets it.
 *
 *   3. BOTH LAYERS ARE CHECKED on every daemon reply. A command can be
 *      REJECTED (busy, expired, stale) with a non-"ok" transport status, OR
 *      admitted and then fail in the browser (`result.ok === false`). A caller
 *      that branches only on the transport status reads a failed act as
 *      success — which is exactly how `unimplemented_in_w1` used to surface as
 *      HTTP 200. `unwrapCommand` is the single place both are read.

 * with a freshly built toolset (`registry.ts` rebuilds the toolset per request;
 * `chat-v2.ts` replays the approved call through a new `buildBrowserTools`).
 * So the per-request map was empty on exactly the act a person had just stopped
 * to think about — `tokenFor` returned undefined and the act ran UNPINNED.
 * L3 stale-targeting protection was, in practice, working only for unattended
 * evals.
 *
 * KEYED BY THE APPROVAL FLOW AND THE `bootId`. The boot id is the thing that
 * rotates exactly when every token must be dropped — a daemon that restarted
 * is a browser whose pages are gone — but it is not enough on its own: one
 * project's browser serves every chat the member has open on it, so an
 * observation in conversation B would overwrite the token conversation A's
 * pending approved act was decided from. A would then resume and pin to B's
 * NEWER token, and the daemon would accept an act chosen from A's older page
 * — a pin that looks like protection and is not. The flow is the chat session
 * (`runKey`), which is the identity that spans the approval pause.
 *
 * A caller that names NO FLOW remembers nothing and recalls nothing, which is
 * where every act sat before this existed. Sharing one unscoped entry between
 * such callers would never be more permissive than that baseline — the guard
 * only ever refuses — but it would be more permissive than a correctly scoped
 * pin, which is the thing this is supposed to be. A pin that is right for the
 * wrong conversation reads downstream exactly like one that is right, and
 * nothing below here can tell them apart; the honest answer where we cannot
 * name the flow is to say nothing.
 *
 * PER PROCESS, deliberately not shared. A resume served by another replica
 * finds nothing and runs unpinned, which is today's behaviour for every act:
 * degradation back to the status quo, not a correctness loss. Making it shared
 * state would mean a cross-request cache of page fingerprints, which is a much
 * larger thing than the bug it fixes.
