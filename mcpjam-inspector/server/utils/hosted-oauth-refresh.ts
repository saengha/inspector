 * one on a call that structurally cannot succeed, and once it is empty the
 * backend returns a plain 429 — locking the user out of a refresh that needs
 * nothing from the backend.
 *
 * In-memory and process-local, never persisted, and it only ever populates on
 * a non-hosted process: the write happens after a successful local refresh,
 * and `refreshTokensAgainstPrivateAuthorizationServer` throws on `HOSTED_MODE`
 * before dialing. A hosted replica therefore holds nothing here, and
 * `declareLocalRuntime: !HOSTED_MODE` means the backend would withhold the
 * material anyway. Horizontal hosted deployments see no behaviour change.
 *
 * Process-local is NOT single-owner, though. Two local inspectors (desktop and
 * `npx`), or several replicas of a self-hosted non-hosted-mode deployment,
 * share one backend credential while each keeps its own copy of this map — so
 * an entry can be superseded by a refresh this process never saw. Treat a
 * cache hit as a guess: `cachedMaterialFallback` below is what keeps a stale
 * guess from being reported as a dead credential.
 *
 * Keyed by SUBJECT as well as project and server. NOT because one process
 * serves several users concurrently — a non-hosted process binds to 127.0.0.1
 * and only serves its session token to localhost. Because one process outlives
 * one signed-in user: sign out, sign in as someone else with access to the
 * same project, and a `projectId:serverId` key hands the second user the
 * first's cached refresh token, after which `importRefreshedTokens` writes the
 * rotated result into the second user's credential. The bearer is hashed,
