/**
 * Server-side PostHog capture for business-critical events.
 *
 * Client-side capture is ad-blockable even through the /relay proxy (a user
 * can disable JS, block the app origin, or race a page close); events that
 * feed funnel/billing/activation decisions get a server-side twin fired from
 * the route that performs the action. During the parallel-run window the
 * server twin is named `<event>_server` (see shared/analytics-events.ts) and
 * the client/server pair ratio per platform is the live block-rate metric.
 *
 * Identity contract: distinct_id MUST match the client's actorKey — the
 * WorkOS user id for signed-in users, the guestId for guests. Those arrive
 * in the request log context as userExternalId / guestExternalId after the
 * Convex authorize exchange (see routes/web/auth.ts). The Convex-internal
 * `userId` (also on the context) does NOT match and must never be used.
 * Events with no resolvable actor are dropped rather than captured
 * anonymously — an unmatched distinct_id would pollute person profiles.
 *
 * Server events go straight to us.i.posthog.com (server egress is never
 * ad-blocked) — NOT through /relay.
