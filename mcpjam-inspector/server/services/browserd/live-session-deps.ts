/**
 * VALIDATE-ON-STAGING — the ONLY live E2B/Convex seam construction for
 * durable browser sessions. Everything decision-bearing lives (unit-tested)
 * in `browser-session.ts`; this file supplies the real deps:
 *
 *   - reserve/ensure a desktop computer via the control plane (user bearer,
 *     `runtimeKind: "desktop-browser"` — never omit the kind);
 *   - exchange the computer id for its vendor sandbox id (service token);
 *   - connect to the sandbox via `@e2b/desktop` (a superset of the core `e2b`
 *     Sandbox: same commands/files/getHost, plus the desktop `stream` API the
 *     M0 spike validated — `stream.start({ requireAuth: true })` mints the
 *     password and holds it in memory, which is exactly why the session row
 *     must cache it);
 *   - the daemon bundle bytes embedded in the server build, and their sha256
 *     (the row's `bundleHash` identity).
 *
 * The W1 debug route (`routes/internal/computer-browser-debug.ts`) shares the
 * adapters below so the staging probe exercises the SAME seam construction
 * production uses.
 *
 * NOTE the reuse path never touches this file's sandbox half: a healthy
 * daemon is verified over HTTP alone. Only relaunches pay the connect cost —
 * and only relaunches can be broken by a wrong guess in here, which is what
 * the morning staging probe exists to catch.
