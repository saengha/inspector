/**
 * A `DriverContext` over Electron `WebContentsView`s on a hidden holder window.
 *
 * This is the whole reason the desktop app can have an agent browser. The
 * packaged app ships no `node_modules`, so the local engine's
 * `import("playwright")` rejects there — but Electron IS a Chromium, and one
 * view per tab gives the driver everything a Playwright page did. Nothing is
 * downloaded and there is no profile lock to fight over, because the app's own
 * `requestSingleInstanceLock` already guarantees one process.
 *
 * VIEWS ON ONE HIDDEN HOLDER, NOT A WINDOW EACH. A `WebContentsView` can be
 * moved between windows, which is what makes the browser SHOWABLE: the pane
 * reparents the active view into the app's own window at the rail's bounds, and
 * the person is looking at Chromium rather than at a JPEG of it. A
 * `BrowserWindow` per tab could not do that — and it also made Electron count
 * every agent tab as a window, so `window-all-closed` never fired and the app
 * never quit.
 *
 * The holder is a `BaseWindow`, created lazily and never shown. It exists to
 * OWN the views while nobody is looking at them: a view with no parent is not
 * rendered at all, and an unrendered page starves the screencast and stops
 * running timers. `visibleWindows()` in `src/main.ts` never lists a
 * `BaseWindow`, so the app's own window accounting is unaffected.
 *
 * ONE VIEW PER TAB, AND WHY IT IS CAPPED. Each is a renderer PROCESS, so a page
 * that opens popups without limit would otherwise spawn processes without limit
 * inside the user's editor. The cap refuses instead, in prose the driver
 * reports rather than swallowing.
 *
 * BUNDLE SAFETY. `electron` is `import type` at the top level only; the runtime
 * `await import("electron")` is inside `launchElectronContext`, behind the
 * caller's `ELECTRON_APP` check. `electron` is already external in
 * `server/tsup.config.ts` and `vite.main.config.ts`, and nothing under
 * `daemon/**` reaches this file.
