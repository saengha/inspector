/**
 * A `DriverPage` over one Electron `webContents`.
 *
 * The packaged desktop app ships no `node_modules`, so `import("playwright")`
 * rejects there and the local engine — which otherwise runs fine in Electron —
 * had a browser it could never launch. Electron already IS a Chromium, and
 * `webContents.debugger` speaks CDP 1.3, which is everything the driver needs:
 * navigation, input, the AX tree, screenshots and the screencast. Nothing is
 * downloaded.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THIS CHEAP. `daemon/viewport.ts` is written against `CdpLike`
 * rather than against Playwright, so the pane, the screencast, the quality
 * governor and input forwarding all work here the moment `cdp()` answers. This
 * file only has to cover the act verbs and the observations, and even those
 * mostly reduce to "find the node, get its box, aim at the middle".
 *
 * ERROR PROSE IS LOAD-BEARING. `chromium-driver.ts` classifies a thrown message
 * with `/timeout|not found|no element|strict mode/i` — matching turns it into
 * `target_not_found` ("the button isn't there", which the model can act on),
 * and anything else becomes `act_failed` (a daemon fault). Every throw below is
 * worded to land on the right side of that test.
 *
 * BUNDLE SAFETY. `electron` appears here only as an `import type`, which
 * erases. This module is never in the daemon bundle's entry graph — the E2B box
 * has no Electron and must never try to resolve one.

   *
   * The classification used to run as page JS through `document.querySelector`,
   * which a page can replace — and a thrown classifier was treated as "carry
   * on", so any page could switch the guard off and collect the click it was
   * meant to prevent. `DOM.describeNode` answers from the protocol side, where
   * page script cannot reach.
   *
   * `contenteditable` is the one property that has to be COMPUTED (it
   * inherits, so a span inside an editable div is editable and carries no
   * attribute of its own), and there is no protocol-side answer for it. Three
   * things keep that page-computed answer from being a way back in:
   *
   *   - EVERY TAG WHOSE CLICK DOES SOMETHING is refused before the probe runs.
   *     Not just the form controls: a `<button>` and an `<a>` are as bad to
   *     click as a submit input, and they are not `INPUT`, so without this
   *     they reached the probe and a page that lied about `isContentEditable`
   *     got them pressed. Filling one is nonsense in any case, so they are
   *     refused whether or not they claim to be editable.
   *   - the `contenteditable` ATTRIBUTE is read from CDP first, so the common
   *     case never asks the page at all — but only the values the spec
   *     actually defines answer from it, because an invalid one means
   *     "inherit", not "editable".
   *   - the probe runs over a node CDP resolved — never a selector the page
   *     could re-answer — and it FAILS CLOSED.
   *
   * What a lie can still buy, then, is a click on an inert element: a `<div>`
   * or a `<span>`. Which is nothing, because a page wanting that click can
   * simply BE contenteditable and get it honestly.
