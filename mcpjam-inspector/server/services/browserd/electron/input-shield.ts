/**
 * The native input shield.
 *
 * A `WebContentsView` is a sibling of the renderer, not a node in it: it
 * paints over whatever the app draws in that rectangle, it does not
 * participate in z-index, and it takes its input straight from the OS. So the
 * obvious way to say "clicking here takes the browser" — a React overlay with
 * a pointer handler — is drawn UNDERNEATH the thing it is meant to cover, and
 * the click it was supposed to intercept lands in the page instead. Every
 * other engine shows a canvas and can simply not forward what it receives;
 * here there is nothing to not forward.
 *
 * So the shield is a second native view, empty and transparent, parented above
 * the browser at the same rectangle. It is invisible and it is not a picture
 * of anything: its whole job is to be what the OS delivers the click to.
 *
 * ── Why no preload, and no page script ──────────────────────────────────
 * `webContents.on("input-event")` fires in the MAIN process for every input
 * event routed to a `webContents` — mouse, wheel and keyboard alike. That is
 * the trusted observation this needs, and it needs no script in the page, no
 * preload, no IPC channel and no bridge. A shield that ran a script would be a
 * renderer this app has to reason about; this one loads `about:blank` and
 * never executes anything.
 *
 * ── What it deliberately does not do ────────────────────────────────────
 * It does not synthesize the intercepted event into the page afterwards. On
 * every other engine the pane holds the initiating interaction and delivers it
 * once the lease lands, because it knows exactly where the click was in the
 * page's own coordinates. Here it does not: the shield sees the event in ITS
 * view's space, the acquire is a round trip, and a page that scrolled or
 * navigated during it would receive a click aimed at what used to be there —
 * precisely the failure `stale_observation` exists to catch. So the shield
 * takes the browser and gets out of the way, and the person's next click, a
 * fraction of a second later into a page they can see, is the one that lands.
 * One extra click in exchange for never clicking the wrong thing.
 *
 * ── No Electron import ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The constructor arrives as an argument, like every other Electron
 * constructor in this directory: `electron-context.ts` is the one module that
 * loads Electron, and it does so behind a dynamic import so the server graph
 * can be required on a machine that has none.
 */

/**
 * The events that mean somebody is USING the page.

 * `mouseMove` is deliberately absent: a pointer crossing the window on the way
 * to the chat box is not an intervention, and taking the agent's browser for
 * one would be the native version of taking it on a hover. `mouseEnter` and
 * `mouseLeave` likewise.
 *
 * `keyUp` is absent too, for a different reason: the key that went down
 * already took the browser, and counting its release would be a second gesture
 * for one keystroke.
