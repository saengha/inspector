/**
 * The agent's browser as a REAL window, not a picture of one.
 *
 * On Electron the browser is already local: a `WebContentsView` is Chromium,
 * running in this process, a few hundred microseconds from the pixels. Sending
 * it to the pane as JPEGs over a socket — encode, base64, parse, decode, paint —
 * is a round trip through three format changes to show somebody a page their own
 * machine already has. Parenting the view into the window instead is the whole
 * point of this file: no frames, no socket, no input latency.
 *
 * IMPORT-FREE AT MODULE SCOPE, exactly like `agent-windows.ts` and for the same
 * reason: `src/main.ts`'s IPC layer reads this registry, and its own header
 * forbids reaching into the server graph at load time — importing the context
 * would drag in the page, the CDP adapter and `utils/logger.ts`, which
 * initialises Sentry and Axiom as a side effect of being loaded. Constructors
 * arrive through `install()`.
 *
 * THE INPUT GATE IS SERVER-AUTHORITATIVE. A picture cannot be clicked into; a
 * real view can. So the view's visibility and its acceptance of input are
 * driven by the DAEMON's lease (`daemon/lease.ts`'s `onChange`), never by the
 * renderer — a client-side gate is not a gate. And a view held by somebody
 * ELSE is hidden rather than merely deafened: a visible native view showing a
 * page while another person types their password into it is an observation,
 * which is the one thing the lease exists to prevent.

 * the app draws in that rectangle, it does not participate in z-index, and it
 * takes its input straight from the OS. So a React overlay — the obvious way
 * to say "clicking here takes the browser" — is drawn UNDERNEATH the thing it
 * is meant to cover, and the click it was supposed to intercept lands in the
 * page instead. On every other engine the picture is a canvas and the pane can
 * simply not forward what it receives; here there is nothing to not forward.
 *
 * The shield is therefore a second native view, owned by the main process,
 * parented above the browser and covering exactly the same rectangle. It is
 * empty and transparent, so it is invisible; what it does is receive the
 * pointer and key events that would otherwise reach the page, and report the
 * first of them as a request to take the browser.
