 * Durable browser sessions (W2): ensure a live browserd daemon on a desktop
 * computer, replica-independently.
 *
 * The happy path never touches the sandbox: reserve → look up the session row
 * → verify the daemon itself over its authenticated `/v1/status` (liveness +
 * bootId + bearer in one probe) → reuse. Only when the row is missing, stale,
 * or the daemon fails verification does this connect to the sandbox and
 * relaunch: kill any leftover daemon, upload the bundle, boot, ensure the
 * auth-required stream (whose password the stream mints and holds only in
 * memory), and RECORD the result — the record is load-bearing, because the
 * stream password exists nowhere else durable and an unrecorded runtime is
 * one no replica can later find (record failure ⇒ stop the daemon and
 * refuse).
 *
 * Recovery posture is health-check, NOT kill-on-wake: a paused→resumed box
 * keeps its process tree, so a healthy daemon with the recorded bootId is
 * reused as-is and in-flight command idempotency survives.
 *
 * This is orchestration ONLY, in the same injected-seam form as
 * `browser-debug-probe.ts`: every live piece (Convex reserve/sandbox-info,
 * `Sandbox.connect`, the stream bootstrap, the session store) arrives via
 * `BrowserSessionDeps`, so the sequence — and every refusal path — is
 * unit-testable without E2B or the network. The live construction lives in
 * `live-session-deps.ts` (VALIDATE-ON-STAGING).

 *
 * A `took` becomes a fence: while we hold it no pane can acquire, and the kill
 * below discards it along with the process. If the kill fails we hand it back,
 * because a lease left on a LIVE daemon blocks the agent and every person.
 *
 * OUR OWN DEBRIS IS NOT A PERSON. A fence outlives its relaunch if this
 * process dies between the take and the kill; on expiry it parks, and a parked
 * lease never auto-frees, so a naive refusal would then brick the box forever —
 * and brick it precisely because of the guard meant to protect it. Only this
 * function mints holders with `RELAUNCH_HOLDER_PREFIX`, so a hold under that
 * prefix can only be an interrupted relaunch, and stepping over it is the same
 * judgement `profile-lock.ts` makes about a stale `SingletonLock`.
 *
 * Best-effort about REACHING the daemon, never about the answer: a transport
 * failure or a client too old to have the endpoint means nobody could be
 * driving it through us either, so the relaunch proceeds — but a daemon that
