/**
 * What the page asked the network for, and what came back.
 *
 * The daemon could already hand back a picture, a tree, the text and the
 * console, and none of those answer the question a broken page most often
 * poses: the layout is right, the list is empty, and nothing was logged. The
 * reason is almost always on the wire — a 401 on the fetch behind the list, a
 * request that never fired, a CORS preflight refused. Without this a model can
 * only re-read a page that will keep looking the same.
 *
 * A RING, LIKE THE CONSOLE, for the same reason: this is a tail somebody reads
 * after an act, not a document, and a page that loads a hundred images an
 * hour must not be able to grow it without bound.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT KEPT is the point of the shape below. Request and response
 * bodies are never retained — a form post carries what someone typed, and a
 * response carries whatever the account can see. Headers are kept only from a
 * fixed allowlist, so `authorization`, `cookie` and `set-cookie` are not
 * dropped by a rule that has to remember them; they are absent because
 * nothing copies them in. A body is readable only LIVE, through an explicit
 * per-request read, and even then it is capped and never stored.
