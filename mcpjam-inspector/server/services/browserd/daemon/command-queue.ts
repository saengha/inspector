/**
 * The daemon's real at-most-once command queue.
 *
 * `computerCommands` in Convex is only a post-hoc, best-effort log (see
 * `run-command.ts`), so the actual at-most-once guarantee has to live HERE, in
 * the process that drives the browser. The rules, from the plan:
 *
 *   1. Unseen commandId  → claim it, execute on the command's per-queue FIFO
 *      (one queue per tab serializes manual + chat + inspector + eval traffic;
 *      whole-session commands share one queue). At the depth cap → `busy` (429).
 *   2. Duplicate WHILE running → attach to the in-flight promise. One execution,
 *      both callers get the same NORMALIZED result — even if the executor throws.
 *   3. Duplicate AFTER settle → return the recorded result (no re-execution).
 *      Results are retained LRU `maxRetained` / TTL `retainTtlMs`; a cache hit
 *      refreshes recency, so eviction is genuinely least-recently-USED.
 *   4. Duplicate after the result was EVICTED → `expired` (409). Never re-run:
 *      the caller must treat the original outcome as unknown.
 *
 * bootId staleness (a commandId replayed against a *different* daemon boot) is
 * handled one layer up, at the HTTP boundary, before a command reaches this
 * queue — a fresh boot has a fresh queue with no memory of the old id, so the
 * daemon compares the caller's expected bootId to its own and rejects a mismatch
 * as `command_unknown_boot`. This queue is per-boot by construction.
