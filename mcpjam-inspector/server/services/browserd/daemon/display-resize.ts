/**
 * Changing the size of a hosted box's X display, without restarting anything.
 *
 * The hosted engine is the one where "the display IS the page" is literally
 * true: Chromium runs in kiosk mode filling the X screen, the video encoder
 * grabs that screen with `x11grab`, and the page's CSS viewport is whatever
 * the window ended up being. So a resize there is not one operation but four
 * that have to agree — the display, the kiosk browser, the page viewport, and
 * the capture geometry — and any pair of them disagreeing produces a picture
 * whose coordinates lie.
 *
 * ── Why this is possible at all ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * It was not, under Xvfb. Xvfb fixes its screen geometry when it starts, so
 * the only way to give a box a different display was to restart X — taking
 * the desktop, the kiosk browser and every open page with it, mid-session,
 * because somebody dragged a divider. The desktop image now boots TigerVNC's
 * Xvnc, which implements RandR on a running server and accepts a resize over
 * it. (https://tigervnc.org/doc/Xvnc.html)
 *
 * ── The order, and why it is this order ─────────────────────────────────
 * The display FIRST, then everything that reads it. A kiosk window told to
 * fill a screen that has not grown yet fills the old one, and a capture
 * started against a screen mid-resize reads torn frames. Going the other way
 * — page first, display last — is worse: the page reflows to a size the
 * display cannot show, and the right-hand strip of every screenshot is
 * missing, which is the failure mode that looks like nothing is wrong.
 *
 * ── What happens when it fails ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * The last CONFIRMED geometry is restored and the caller is told. Never a
 * half-applied transition: a display at one size with a page laid out for
 * another is a browser whose every coordinate is wrong, and it is wrong
 * silently. `NEVER PUBLISH DIMENSIONS THAT DISAGREE WITH THE DISPLAYED FRAME`
 * is the rule the whole responsive path rests on, and this is the place it is
 * easiest to break.
