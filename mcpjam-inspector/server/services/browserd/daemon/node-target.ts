/**
 * Aiming at a node the model NAMED, rather than at a point it guessed.
 *
 * A ref is the only target a model can produce without reading pixels: the
 * accessibility tree already tells it `button "Sign in" [ref=e7]`, and until
 * this file existed the only thing it could do with that was refuse. The
 * coordinate path asks the model to translate a description into a pixel and
 * be right about it; the selector path asks it to invent CSS for a page it has
 * only seen as a tree. Both are guesses. A ref is not.
 *
 * EVERYTHING HERE IS CDP, and deliberately so. `DriverPage` (`browser-page.ts`)
 * is the per-engine seam, and node resolution is the same protocol on both
 * engines — Electron already did all of this by hand for its selector path
 * (`electron/electron-page.ts`), and Playwright's own selector path never
 * learns a node id at all. So the shared code lives here and each engine
 * contributes only its `cdp()`, exactly as the a11y tree does (`cdp-a11y.ts`).
 *
 * TWO COORDINATE SPACES, and they are not interchangeable:
 *
 *   - `DOM.getBoxModel` answers in the TOP frame's viewport, which is the
 *     space `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` and `DriverPage.clickAt` take. That is
 *     the point we click.
 *   - `document.elementFromPoint` answers in ITS OWN document's viewport. So
 *     the occlusion check never carries a point across the boundary: it runs
 *     inside the element's own document and computes the centre there.
 *
 * Mixing them is how an occlusion check on an iframe reports the wrong element
 * with total confidence, so the two are computed separately from the same node
 * and never converted into each other.
