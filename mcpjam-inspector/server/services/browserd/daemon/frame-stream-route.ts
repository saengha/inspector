/**
 * `GET /v1/frames` — the daemon's way of getting screencast frames out of its
 * sandbox.
 *
 * Served by the http adapter rather than by `BrowserdRequestHandler`, because a
 * chunked body is not a `DaemonResponse`: the handler's contract is one status
 * and one JSON object, and this route's whole nature is that it keeps writing.
 * It borrows the handler's `authorize` so the gate is the same one, not a
 * second copy that can drift.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THIS SAFE TO LEAVE OPEN. Three timers, and each exists because of
 * a specific way a one-way stream lies to you:
 *
 *   - The HEARTBEAT re-asks the lease question. `subscribeFrames` revokes on
 *     frame delivery, which is perfect for a page that paints and useless for
 *     one that does not — and "the page is static" is exactly when somebody is
 *     reading it. Without this tick, a person taking the lease over a still
 *     page never evicts the watcher. That is the privacy hole the lease exists
 *     to close, and a transport with no client ping reopens it.
 *   - The same tick asks `stillCurrent()`. A disposed viewport stops calling
 *     its listeners without telling them, so a closed or crashed tab otherwise
 *     reads as a quiet one, forever.
 *   - The STALL WATCHDOG bounds a peer that stops reading. A TCP zero-window or
 *     an edge that goes away never fires the write callback, so the pacer's
 *     in-flight slot never clears — and the subscription behind it keeps
 *     `Page.startScreencast` and a JPEG encoder running on a box the agent is
 *     also trying to use.
