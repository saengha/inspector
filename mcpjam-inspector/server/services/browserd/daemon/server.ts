/**
 * The thin Node-http adapter for browserd's control plane.

 * enforce a body-size limit, call the handler, and write the JSON response. It
 * also assembles the full daemon stack from a `BrowserDriver` — mint the
 * per-boot id, build the command queue with the staleness-guarded executor, and
 * hand both to the handler — and emits the stdout ready-line the boot recipe
 * (PR c) waits on.
