/**
 * JavaScript dialogs — `alert`, `confirm`, `prompt`, `beforeunload`.
 *
 * A dialog stops the renderer. Not "slows": stops. `requestAnimationFrame`
 * never fires, so the settle step burns its whole 10s budget and reports an
 * unsettled page; the next screenshot is the frame from before the dialog; and
 * every subsequent command does the same thing again. Until now nothing in the
 * daemon knew what a dialog was, so a page that called `confirm()` on a click
 * left the tab in exactly that state for as long as the browser lived, and the
 * model was told only that its actions were not settling.
 *
 * THE DEFAULTS ARE THE SAFE ANSWER, NOT THE AGREEABLE ONE. A model cannot see
 * a dialog and cannot be asked about one, so an agent-driven dialog is
 * answered the way an absent user's browser should answer it:
 *
 *   - `alert` — dismissed. There is only one button; the page has been read.
 *   - `confirm` — CANCELLED. "Delete this account?" defaults to no, and a
 *     dialog is the one place a page asks a question whose default answer we
 *     are choosing on someone's behalf.
 *   - `prompt` — cancelled, for the same reason plus one: any text we invented
 *     would be a value the page attributes to the user.
 *   - `beforeunload` — accepted, because the agent asked to navigate and this
 *     is the page asking whether it meant it.
 *
 * WHAT WAS DECIDED IS RECORDED, on the result, so the model is never left to
 * infer it. "I clicked Delete and the page did nothing" and "I clicked Delete,
 * a confirmation appeared, and it was cancelled on your behalf" lead to
 * completely different next moves.
