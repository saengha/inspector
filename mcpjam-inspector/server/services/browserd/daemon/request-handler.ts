/**
 * browserd's HTTP control plane — the pure request handler.
 *
 * It wraps PR (a)'s command queue with the wire concerns the daemon boundary
 * owns, and NOTHING else:
 *
 *   - per-request bearer auth (every endpoint is public over `getHost`);
 *   - `bootId` identity: the daemon mints one per process start and echoes it on
 *     every response, and REJECTS a command whose caller expected a different
 *     boot (`command_unknown_boot`) rather than re-running it — the first
 *     execution's fate across a restart is unknowable, so replaying would lie;
 *   - mapping the queue's `BrowserCommandOutcome` to an HTTP status;
 *   - surfacing the L3 stale-observation refusal as `409 stale_observation`.
 *
 * It is transport-agnostic: it takes a parsed `DaemonRequest` and returns a
 * `DaemonResponse`, so it is unit-testable without a socket. The thin Node-http
 * adapter that reads the body and writes the response lives in `server.ts`.
