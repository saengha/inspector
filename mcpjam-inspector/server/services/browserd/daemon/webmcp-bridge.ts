/**
 * The WebMCP half of the daemon: page-registered tools, discovered and invoked
 * over Chrome's experimental `WebMCP` CDP domain.
 *
 * This is the cooperation layer, not the drive mechanism — `navigate`/`act`/
 * `observe` are how browserd gets work done; `webmcp_*` is the bonus when a
 * page chooses to expose structured tools. Node, cloud and Electron use this
 * shared state machine, which preserves these browser-specific behaviors:
 *
 *   - identity is `${frameId} ${name}`, the browser's own notion;
 *   - navigation fires NO `toolsRemoved` and the main frame KEEPS its id, so
 *     the navigated frame's tools are dropped on `Page.frameNavigated` or the
 *     registry serves tools that no longer exist;
 *   - a cancel is answered `Canceled` whatever the reason, so WHY we cancelled
 *     is remembered locally — otherwise a timeout is reported as a user
 *     cancellation;
 *   - a cancel that the page never answers still settles, so a caller is never
 *     left waiting on a browser that is gone.
 *
 * MORE THAN ONE CDP SESSION. A cross-origin frame is a separate Chromium
 * target: its tools never reach the page's session and it is not even in that
 * session's `Page.getFrameTree` (pinned in `webmcp-cdp.spike.test.ts`). So the
 * bridge listens on a SET of sessions — the page's, plus one per
 * separately-targeted frame — and merges what they report into the single tool
 * map. CDP frame ids are unique across sessions, so merging changes no
 * identity; what each entry additionally remembers is WHICH session registered
 * it, because a session's teardown may arrive after its replacement has
 * already registered tools for the same frame and cleanup keyed on frame id
 * alone would empty a frame that is working.
 *
 * The bridge never learns what a Playwright `Frame` or an Electron
 * `webContents` is: the provider decides when a frame has its own target and
 * hands over a `CdpLike` through {@link WebMcpBridge.addSession}.
 *
 * Written against an injected `CdpLike`, so all of it is unit-testable with a
 * fake CDP session — no Chromium required. Chromium and Electron adapters
 * supply the same contract; WebMCP inspection reuses the daemon's tab owner.
