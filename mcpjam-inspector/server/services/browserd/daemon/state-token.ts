/**
 * L3 — computing a tab's observation state token.
 *
 * Every capture the driver returns carries one of these (see `protocol.ts`); a
 * later `act` may pin itself to the token it was decided from, and the daemon
 * refuses the act if the token no longer matches — the production failure mode
 * is not duplicate delivery (the command queue handles that) but STALE
 * targeting: a click computed from a screenshot that a late-loading banner has
 * shifted. The token must therefore change whenever the page navigates OR
 * mutates structurally, and be stable otherwise.
 *
 * This module is the pure computation only: the driver supplies the raw facts
 * (the tab's nav counter, its URL, and a structural signal of the DOM) and this
 * turns them into a token. Keeping it pure makes both the hashing and the
 * change-detection semantics unit-testable without a browser.
