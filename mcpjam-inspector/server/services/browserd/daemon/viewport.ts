/**
 * Watching the page, and touching it — over CDP, for every engine.
 *
 * The model gets screenshots through the command queue. A PERSON needs
 * something else: a live picture, and a way to click and type into it, so they
 * can solve the CAPTCHA or the SSO prompt the agent cannot. That is what this
 * is, and it is written against `CdpLike` — the same two-method surface the
 * WebMCP bridge uses — so the local engine's Playwright session, the hosted
 * daemon's, and Electron's `webContents.debugger` all satisfy it without a
 * line of per-engine code.
 *
 * FOUR PROPERTIES, each of which is a bug if dropped. They are the WebMCP
 * inspector's, learned there against a real Chromium (see
 * `docs/webmcp-inspector.md`), and they do not stop being true because the
 * frames now come from browserd:
 *
 *   1. ACK FIRST. Chromium sends the next frame only once the current one is
 *      acknowledged. Acking after consumption lets a slow consumer starve the
 *      stream into stillness — the pane freezes on whatever it was showing
 *      when the consumer fell behind, with nothing to correct it.
 *   2. A BYTE-IDENTICAL FRAME IS DROPPED. Every `Page.captureScreenshot` makes
 *      Chromium produce a compositor frame to satisfy the copy, and the
 *      screencast sends that frame back verbatim. Publishing it would make
 *      each capture induce the next one.
 *   3. THE TRAILING FRAME IS MANDATORY. The last paint of a burst is the one
 *      that shows what the page ended up looking like; a plain drop-inside-the
 *      -window throttle loses exactly that frame and leaves a settled page
 *      stale forever.
 *   4. FRAMES NEVER TICK THE IDLE CLOCK, but SUBSCRIBING does. A CSS spinner
 *      paints forever, and a browser that could not be reaped while animating
 *      would outlive the person who opened it. Asking for the stream is a
 *      person arriving; a frame is not.
 *
 * The stream is demand-driven: Chromium is told to paint only while someone is
 * watching, and told to stop when the last of them leaves.
