/**
 * The browser command ledger — one ordered record of everything that was asked
 * of this browser, and what happened.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES IN THE DAEMON, and specifically at the request handler's command
 * entry rather than around the executor: the executor never sees a refusal. A
 * lease refusal is answered before `queue.submit`, so is `command_unknown_boot`,
 * and the queue's own `busy` / `expired` / `at_capacity` outcomes never reach an
 * executor either. A wrapper around `CommandExecutor` would therefore record
 * exactly the commands that ran and silently lose every command that was
 * REFUSED — and "the agent tried to drive while a person held the browser" is
 * the single most useful row in the whole trace. The handler is the one place
 * that sees every disposition, so the handler writes the row.
 *
 * WHY THE DAEMON RATHER THAN THE INSPECTOR: the daemon is where the lease is
 * enforced and where every source's commands converge on one per-tab FIFO —
 * manual, chat, inspector, eval and agent alike. One ring here is one ORDER,
 * minted by one counter. Two rings, one per caller, would each be internally
 * ordered and mutually meaningless, and the question a trace exists to answer
 * ("who touched this page, in what order") has no answer in that shape.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT: durable. This ring is bounded and per-boot. The inspector
 * mirrors it into a durable sink (JSONL locally) and the ring's job is to lose
 * nothing between mirrors — and to say so, with a `gap` row, when it does.
 * Missing history is always explicit; nothing here is silently best-effort.
