/**
 * The three calls the browser SHELL makes, on either engine.
 *
 * Split out of `SessionClient` rather than added to it because the audience is
 * different in a way that matters for what may be optional. `SessionClient`'s
 * existing methods are what a MODEL's turn needs, and every engine has to
 * answer them; these are what a PERSON'S PANE needs, and an engine that has
 * none of them is still a perfectly good engine for an eval. So they are one
 * optional group a caller can test for in one place, instead of three
 * independent optional methods that can each be present without the others —
 * which would let a shell draw a tab strip it cannot then navigate.
 *
 * The decoding lives here too, for the reason the daemon's own validators do:
 * this reads a JSON body off a socket, and the two implementations (in-process
 * and over HTTP) would otherwise each decide separately what a malformed one
 * means.
