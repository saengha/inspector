/**
 * Contract v1 ⇄ browserd translation.
 *
 * The public agent contract (`shared/browser-agent-contract.ts`) and the daemon
 * wire (`protocol.ts`) overlap almost completely, which is exactly why this file
 * exists rather than one of them being the other. The daemon's unions change
 * with every engine wave; the contract is what an SDK release promises. Joining
 * them here means a daemon change is a DECISION taken in one place instead of a
 * silent widening of the public surface.
 *
 * The mapping is EXHAUSTIVE by construction, in both directions:
 *
 *   - `toDaemonAction` switches over every contract op, with a `never` check;
 *   - `publishedOpFor` switches over every daemon action kind, with a `never`
 *     check, so ADDING A DAEMON VERB BREAKS THE BUILD HERE. Someone then has to
 *     say whether it is published and under what name — which is the whole
 *     point. A silent fall-through in a browser automation layer looks, from the
 *     outside, like a page that just did not respond.
 *
 * The same pattern as `v1-bridge.ts`, for the same reason.
