/**
 * The browser on THIS machine — the npm engine's half of the agent browser.
 *
 * The hosted engine reserves an E2B desktop, uploads a daemon bundle, boots it
 * and talks to it over HTTPS. None of that exists here. The same daemon stack
 * is constructed in this process (`buildBrowserdStack`), driving a Chromium
 * launched on the user's own machine, and reached through the in-process
 * client. Everything above the client — the six `browser_*` tools, the lease,
 * the queue, the observation budgets — is byte-identical to hosted, which is
 * the whole point: one abstraction, three engines.
 *
 * TRUST MODEL, mirroring `utils/computers/local-machine.ts`:
 *  - This is NOT a sandbox. The browser runs as the OS user, in a profile that
 *    persists their logins. The boundaries are device CONSENT, per-action chat
 *    approval, and the actor gates in `engine.ts` — never the profile path.
 *  - The profile directory is per project because a login for one project
 *    should not silently be a login for another, not because a path confines
 *    anything. What IS validated is the project key, which becomes a path
 *    segment under a fixed root.
 *  - Project secrets never reach this process's Chromium. The env allowlist in
 *    `local-machine.ts` is the precedent and this path does not widen it.
 *
 * LIFECYCLE. One browser per (project, context mode). It outlives a chat turn
 * — a login that vanished between turns would make the persistent profile
 * pointless — and is reaped when idle, when the server stops, and when the
 * desktop app quits. A reap while a person is holding the browser would close
 * the window they are typing into, so a held lease defers it.
