/**
 * The DOOR: a command path into the browser that is not a model's tool loop.
 *
 * Until now a command reached browserd exactly one way — a model called a
 * `browser_*` tool and the harness dispatched it. That is the whole reason an
 * outside coding agent could not drive: there was no path in that did not
 * require being the model. This is that path.
 *
 * It is NOT a way around the daemon's rules. Every command still goes through
 * the in-process client, so the auth check, the lease gate, the bootId check
 * and the idempotent queue all apply exactly as they do for a model. What the
 * door adds is what a non-model caller needs and a model does not: a session
 * that outlives a boot, a policy stated up front instead of a person to ask,
 * an actor stamped by the route that authenticated the caller, and a durable
 * record the caller can read back.
 *
 * WHY POLICY IS ENFORCED HERE AND NOT IN `buildBrowserTools`. That function
 * fails closed without an `approvalDelivery`, and its two deliveries mean
 * precise things: `attested` threads gated calls into a person's approval
 * prompt; `unattended` substitutes a declared policy because nobody is
 * watching. An agent-driven session is neither — there is no engine tool loop
 * to pause, and "a person granted consent and could be watching" is a weaker
 * guarantee than either. So M1 enforces the SAME policy type directly on agent
 * commands and leaves the registry seam alone; the `session-policy` delivery
 * lands with M1.5, when model turns need it too.
