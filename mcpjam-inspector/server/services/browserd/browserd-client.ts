/**
 * The inspector-server → browserd HTTP client: the mirror image of the daemon's
 * request handler (`daemon/request-handler.ts`). Given a booted daemon's public
 * origin + per-boot bearer (from `bootBrowserd`), it sends a `BrowserCommand` to
 * `/v1/commands` and turns the HTTP response back into a typed outcome, and it
 * probes `/healthz`. Everything above it — the debug route, the `browser_*`
 * tools — speaks commands through this client and never touches fetch or
 * status codes directly.
 *
 * This file is now only the TRANSPORT. Every decision about what a reply means
 * lives in `browserd-codec.ts`, shared with the in-process client the local and
 * Electron engines use, so a daemon reply cannot mean two different things
 * depending on which engine received it. The types are re-exported here so the
 * client remains the one import site callers already know.
 *
 * The `expectedBootId` a caller passes is echoed to the daemon so a command
 * replayed against a DIFFERENT boot is rejected (`unknown_boot`) rather than
 * re-run; the caller learns the current bootId from every response and stores it.
