/**
 * The parts of a WebMCP provider that are the same wherever the browser is.
 *
 * Both providers that speak the WebMCP CDP domain — Playwright driving a
 * Chromium it launched, and the Electron one attaching to a `<webview>` the
 * app already has — translate the same bridge failures and live under the same
 * screenshot budget. Those are contracts with the layers ABOVE them (the
 * timeline shows what the translation produced; the export carries what the
 * budget allowed), so two copies would drift into two different behaviours
 * that each look right in their own tests.
 *
 * Deliberately small. Everything else about the two providers really is
 * different — one owns a browser process, the other borrows a surface — and
 * pulling more up here would mean one set of options meaning two things.
