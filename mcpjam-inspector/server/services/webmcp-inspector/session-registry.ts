 * Lifecycle for WebMCP Inspector sessions: capacity, expiry, teardown.

 * for headless widget renders: reserve a slot synchronously BEFORE the async
 * launch so a burst of concurrent starts cannot each pass a point-in-time
 * check; count still-disposing browsers against the cap because `dispose()` is
 * async and the Chromium process outlives the map entry; refuse new work once
 * a permanent shutdown has begun.
 *
 * Two differences from that template, both because this browser is one a person
 * is looking at:
 *   - The idle clock is refreshed by the BROWSER's own activity as well as by
 *     API calls, so a session someone is using through its own window is not
 *     reaped while the inspector tab sits closed.
 *   - There is an absolute lifetime as well as an idle timeout. A page left
 *     open overnight, quietly firing timers, would otherwise never look idle.
