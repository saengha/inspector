/**
 * The contract test for Chrome's experimental CDP `WebMCP` domain.
 *
 * Every fact the WebMCP Inspector's provider relies on is asserted here against
 * a real browser, so a Chromium bump that changes the domain fails THIS test
 * with a named expectation rather than surfacing as a broken feature. The
 * domain is marked experimental and the page API has already churned once
 * (`navigator.` → `document.modelContext`), which is exactly why the provider
 * speaks CDP and why this file exists.
 *
 * Pinned surface: Playwright 1.62.1 / Chromium 151.0.7922.34.
 *
 * Findings encoded below that the implementation depends on:
 *   1. `WebMCP.enable` resolves even when the feature is OFF — it is not a
 *      support probe. Support is probed in the page.
 *   2. `invokeTool` takes `{frameId, toolName, input}` and returns
 *      `{invocationId}` IMMEDIATELY, before the tool settles.
 *   3. `toolInvoked.input` is a JSON STRING; `toolResponded.output` is an
 *      OBJECT, and is present only when status is `Completed`.
 *   4. Statuses are `Completed | Canceled | Error` (one "l" in Canceled).
 *      On `Error`, `errorText` is empty and the real message is on
 *      `exception.description`.
 *   5. Unknown tool / unknown invocation id reject at the CDP layer instead of
 *      producing a `toolResponded`.
 *   6. NAVIGATION FIRES NO `toolsRemoved`. The provider MUST synthesize
 *      removal, or a page's tools accumulate across navigations forever.
 *   7. Tools registered in a CROSS-ORIGIN subframe never reach the page's CDP
 *      session, and the subframe is not in `Page.getFrameTree` — it is a
 *      separate target. This is WHY a session per such frame is necessary, and
 *      attaching one is what makes those tools visible and invocable (12).
 *   8. ANNOTATIONS, PER FIELD. The page API reads the `*Hint` keys and the CDP
 *      `Annotation` type reports them under bare names: `readOnlyHint` →
 *      `readOnly`, `untrustedContentHint` → `untrustedContent`, values and all.
 *      `consequentialHint` is NOT copied at this pin, so `consequential` is
 *      absent even when declared. `autosubmit` only ever comes from markup.
 *      Tools registered with the BARE names get `false` for both, because those
 *      keys are not the ones Blink reads.
 *   9. DECLARATIVE tools (`<form toolname>`) carry a `backendNodeId` and NO
 *      `stackTrace` — the inverse of an imperative registration, and the
 *      provenance signal the provider infers `registrationKind` from. Blink
 *      DERIVES their `inputSchema` from the form's controls, including
 *      `format`, `minimum`/`maximum`, `multipleOf`, `pattern` and enums.
 *  10. CROSS-DOCUMENT RESULTS ARE DELIVERED BY THE PLATFORM, natively, for
 *      every navigation shape that stays in this tab: same-document autosubmit,
 *      a named target frame, an imperative `location.href`, a form a person
 *      submits later. The response is `Completed` and `output` is a JSON ARRAY
 *      of every `application/ld+json` block in the destination document —
 *      `[]` when it has none, malformed blocks skipped. No intermediate null
 *      arrives first, and the whole thing lands within tens of milliseconds of
 *      the navigation, orders of magnitude inside the 60s caller deadline.
 *      Measured END TO END per transport as well, because the path between
 *      Blink and us is what was in question: Playwright in
 *      `playwright-provider.integration.test.ts` against a real browser, and
 *      the two boundaries a fake can exercise honestly — the daemon's command
 *      protocol (`browserd-provider.test.ts`) and the Electron debugger adapter
 *      (`electron-webview-provider.test.ts`) — each asserting that a top-level
 *      JSON ARRAY survives the hop as itself rather than being re-wrapped.
 *  11. `target="_blank"` IS THE EXCEPTION and the response is LOST: nothing
 *      arrives on the opener's session, on the new tab's own session, or with
 *      `Target.setAutoAttach` on the opener, and the invocation is not pending
 *      in any renderer. There is nothing to recover — the browser produced no
 *      response, it did not merely route one somewhere we were not listening.
 *  12. A frame with its OWN CDP session reports its tools there, and they are
 *      invocable through it. Invoking a child frame's id on the PAGE's session
 *      is rejected outright ("FrameId does not belong to current target"), so
 *      the session is part of addressing a tool, not an optimisation.
 *  13. A tool that returns a value and THEN navigates is answered TWICE for one
 *      invocation id: its own value first, the destination document's JSON-LD
 *      second. The first is the true outcome; the second must not displace it.
 *  14. A pending DECLARATIVE invocation cannot be cancelled: `cancelInvocation`
 *      rejects its id ("No pending execution for invocation id") while the same
 *      call on a pending imperative one is accepted and answers `Canceled`. So
 *      a form waiting on a person stays live after we have given up on it, and
 *      the bridge has to remember that it settled the caller and drop the
 *      answer that arrives if the person submits later.
