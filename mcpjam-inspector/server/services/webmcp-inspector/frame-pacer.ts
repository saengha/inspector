 * Lifted verbatim out of `routes/web/webmcp-frames.ts`, which still re-exports
 * it, so the WebMCP frame socket keeps the exact behaviour its tests pin. It
 * moved because the browserd DAEMON needs the same pacing for its own frame
 * stream, and the daemon cannot import a Hono route — it is bundled into an
 * artifact that runs on a box with nothing but its own bytes. A second copy of
 * logic this subtle would drift; a neighbour of `frame-throttle.ts`, which the
 * daemon already imports for the same reason, does not.
 *
 * Deliberately transport-agnostic: it knows only a sink that reports when the
 * bytes were actually taken. A WebSocket's `send(data, cb)` and a
 * `ServerResponse`'s `write(chunk, cb)` are the same shape, which is the whole
 * reason one implementation can serve both.

 * already accepted into kernel/browser buffers or prove the viewer painted
 * them. A slow renderer needs client coalescing or explicit viewer feedback.
