/**
 * Swarm (journey-execution) multi-host fan-out runner — PR 3d.
 *
 * Generalizes the PR-3c single-host runner to a bounded host-worker pool over
 * `snapshot.hosts[]`. Each host runs its `sessionsPerTarget` synthetic
 * persona-driven sessions SEQUENTIALLY (one active session per host); at most
 * {@link MAX_CONCURRENT_HOSTS} hosts are active concurrently. The per-session
 * host-turn machinery is the shared {@link runSyntheticHostSession} core
 * (identical to scenario session-simulation); this file owns the swarm surface:
 * the claim→run→persist→terminal attempt ordering, the swarm persona driver,
 * swarm transcript attribution, an independent heartbeat, graceful shutdown
 * registration, and the two run-level short-circuits below.
 *
 * Failure isolation + short-circuits:
 *   - A normal session failure affects only that attempt; the host's other
 *     sessions and every other host continue.
 *   - A PROVIDER rate-limit (a 429 folded to `rate_limited`, message does NOT
 *     look like an org/spend cap) stops scheduling further sessions FOR THAT
 *     HOST and marks its remaining `pending` attempts `rate_limited`. Other
 *     hosts continue.
 *   - An ORG SPEND-CAP breach (message looks like an org/spend cap) stops
 *     scheduling ALL hosts, cancels in-flight turns, and finalizes the run's
 *     remaining pending attempts (`errorCode: "spend_cap_exceeded"`).
 *   - Abort (shutdown / user cancel) stops new scheduling and cancels in-flight
 *     turns AND the (now-cancellable) persona driver, so every in-flight session
 *     unwinds promptly and self-reports its own accurate terminal via the normal
 *     path. The run-level `finalizeRun` best-effort finalizes only the remaining
 *     never-claimed `pending` attempts (`errorCode: "runner_shutdown"`); the
 *     backend stale-run cron is the hard backstop.
