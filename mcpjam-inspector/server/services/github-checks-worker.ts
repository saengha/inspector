 * github-checks-worker.ts — polling executor for GitHub PR check runs.
 *
 * Same pull/claim architecture as `scheduled-evals-worker.ts`: the backend
 * never calls the Inspector. A PR webhook lands a trigger row in Convex; this
 * loop claims one at a time over the service-token-gated
 * `/internal/v1/github-checks/*` routes, builds the PR's MCP server in a
 * disposable sandbox, and drives the EXISTING `prepareEvalRun()` → `execute()`
 * pipeline against it.
 *
 * The worker never talks to GitHub, and it holds no GitHub credential. It
 * reports FACTS; the control plane derives the check conclusion. That split is
 * why a compromised worker cannot write to anyone's repo.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * A3b-2: THE VERDICT IS NO LONGER COMPUTED HERE
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The loop is now `/plan/begin` → attempts → `/complete`, and the backend owns
 * candidate ORDERING, CONTINUE/STOP and ATTRIBUTION (`convex/github/
 * checkPlans.ts`). `/complete` carries NO `outcome` field; the outcome is
 * derived from the attempt log and the BOUND `testSuiteRun`. See
 * `github-checks/check-plan.ts` for the full sequence and the three rules
 * (409 = hard stop, degraded mode, unknown action) that must not be softened.
 *
 * The invariant that survives unchanged: A CLAIMED TRIGGER ALWAYS GETS A
 * COMPLETION. An unreported claim sits until the backend's heartbeat sweep
 * fails it ~5 minutes later, which shows up on someone's PR as a check that
 * hung and then went neutral.
 *
 * Gated by `GITHUB_CHECKS_WORKER_ENABLED === '1'`. That gate stops this
 * process from CLAIMING work; it is not a kill switch for the feature. The
 * backend's `GITHUB_CHECKS_ENABLED` gate — which this comment used to claim
 * 404s the whole surface — no longer exists, so with the worker off the
 * webhook still accepts deliveries and still inserts triggers. They sit
 * `pending` until the backend's 30-minute sweep retires them as
 * `worker_unavailable`, concluding each check neutral with an explanation.
