/**
 * Turning a PR into a reachable MCP server, inside a disposable E2B sandbox.
 *
 * The security shape of this module is the whole point, so it is stated up
 * front. Everything it runs is UNTRUSTED code from a pull request:
 *
 *   - repository code receives no MCPJam-managed credentials. A private clone
 *     authenticates only its completed Git processes, before checkout or build;
 *   - it runs a DEDICATED minimal template (`GITHUB_CHECKS_E2B_TEMPLATE_ID`:
 *     node + git, nothing else), never the shared computer template;
 *   - outbound network is the same NON-GUEST PLATFORM BASELINE used by the
 *     backend: full public internet, with the three RFC1918 private ranges
 *     denied at the provider. This module passes that policy at CREATE time;
 *     the box is never narrowed afterwards. An earlier revision revoked egress
 *     entirely between the build and the start; that is deliberately gone. It
 *     prevented MCP servers from reaching the APIs they test: a large share of MCP
 *     servers exist to proxy an external API, so their tools failed inside a
 *     check — often GREEN, because shallow assertions like
 *     `toolCalledAtLeastOnce` cannot tell a working call from an erroring one.
 *     A silent false pass is worse than the risk being defended against. The
 *     real bounds on abuse are the same ones CI uses: a short TTL and
 *     concurrency caps;
 *   - inbound eval traffic arrives through `getHost(port)`, which is why the box
 *     is created with `allowPublicTraffic: true`;
 *   - the box is ephemeral and killed after the check.
 *
 * Failure attribution matters as much as failure detection. A build that exits
 * non-zero is the PR's problem (`build_failed`); a server that never answers
 * `initialize` is the PR's problem (`server_unhealthy`); E2B being unavailable
 * is OUR problem (`infra_error`). `CheckStepError` carries that verdict so the
 * worker never has to guess from an error message.

/**
 * WHO WE STARTED — captured by the SPAWN, never read back out of the box.
 *
 * This is the anchor the listener-identity check hangs off, and the whole
 * reason it is a type rather than a file: everything running inside the box
 * after `buildAndStart` is PR code, so any identity fact the box WRITES is a
 * fact the PR can forge. An earlier revision of this module had the start
 * wrapper `echo $$ > /tmp/mcp-server.pid` and read that file back; a detached
 * squatter left behind by an install hook could simply overwrite it with its
 * own pid and be recognised as "the server we spawned". The pid file is gone.
 *
 * Both fields come from our side of the boundary:
 *
 *   - `pid` is what E2B's `CommandHandle` reports for the process IT started on
 *     our behalf. Nothing inside the box participates in producing it.
 *   - `pgrp` is read from `/proc/<pid>/stat` IMMEDIATELY after the spawn, while
 *     the process we just started is the one that pid refers to. The value is
 *     the kernel's, and the pid it is keyed on is ours — so the PR cannot
 *     choose it either. Reading it later (at verification time) is what does
 *     not work: by then the supervisor may have exited, `/proc/<pid>` is gone,
 *     and the group is unrecoverable exactly in the reparented/double-forked
 *     case the group check exists to cover.
 *
 * `pgrp` is nullable, and it is null unless the spawn LEADS its group (`pgrp ===
 * pid`). A group we did not create is one other processes were already in — on
 * this image, envd puts every command in the same group — so it identifies
 * nothing. `startCommandScript` uses `setsid` to make the spawn a leader, and
 * `captureSpawnIdentity` refuses the value when that did not happen. Null
 * disables the group fallback and leaves ancestry as the only test — strictly
 * narrower, never wider.

 * The PR's start command, wrapped so its output is bounded on BOTH sides.

 * Redirecting to a file keeps untrusted output out of this process's heap (see

 * the sandbox's disk: a server that logs continuously fills it, and `ENOSPC` can
 * take down the very server we are evaluating — turning a chatty PR into a
 * failing one. So a watchdog truncates the log whenever it grows past the cap.
 *
 * Details that matter:
 *   - APPEND (`>>`), not truncate (`>`). With `>` the writer keeps its offset
 *     across a truncation, leaving a sparse hole whose tail reads as NUL padding;
 *     `O_APPEND` restarts cleanly at zero and keeps `tail -c` meaningful.
 *   - `exec` for the server, so it replaces the shell and kill/signal semantics
 *     stay those of the process itself. It also keeps this shell's pid — the one
 *     E2B reported to us at spawn — pointing at the server itself rather than at
 *     a wrapper that exited.
 *   - `setsid`, so the server leads a process group and session of ITS OWN. This
 *     is a correctness requirement of the identity check, not tidiness. Verified
 *     against the live checks image: E2B's envd runs EVERY command it is asked
 *     for in envd's own process group, so without this the build, the clone and
 *     the start command all share one group — and a detached squatter left by a
 *     build lifecycle hook would match the group of the server we started and be
 *     accepted as ours. `setsid` does not fork here (the shell is not already a
 *     group leader), so the pid E2B reported is preserved and becomes the group
 *     id, which is exactly the value the verifier can recognise. Guarded by a
 *     `command -v`: on an image without it the group is simply not a leader's,
 *     `captureSpawnIdentity` refuses to trust it, and the check narrows to
 *     ancestry alone.
 *   - the watchdog is a child of that shell and needs no cleanup: it dies with
 *     the sandbox, and if it dies early the only consequence is an unbounded log.
 *
 * NOTHING here records identity into the box. It used to (`echo $$ > /tmp/
 * mcp-server.pid`), and that file was writable by every process the PR starts,
 * which made it worthless as proof of who we launched. See `SpawnIdentity`.

 * Whether `capabilities` would survive the schema the client validates a
 * `server/discover` result with.
 *
 * That schema is `ServerCapabilities2026Schema`, reached through
 * `codecForVersion(MODERN_WIRE_REVISION).validateResult("server/discover", …)` —
 * the rev2026 codec. NOT the `ServerCapabilitiesSchema` that the 2025 codec uses
 * for `initialize`. The two are close but not identical, and the difference is
 * load-bearing: the 2026 schema is built from the SEVEN shared members below and
 * omits `tasks` entirely, so a modern server advertising `tasks` in any shape at
 * all has it stripped as an unknown member and negotiates fine. Validating it here
 * rejected servers the client drives — a false `server_unhealthy`.
 *
 * Mirrored field by field rather than shape-only, because the schema does type the
 * nesting of the members it defines: `tools: { listChanged: "yes" }` and
 * `extensions: true` are both objects at the top level and both rejected a level
 * down. A probe that stops at "is it an object" reports the modern arm healthy for
 * a server the client declines to drive there.
 *
 * Unknown keys stay welcome, at every level the schema leaves open: the capability
 * objects are non-strict, so extra members are ignored rather than fatal, and
 * capabilities is explicitly "not a closed set". Only the members it gives a type
 * are checked. `JSONObject`-typed fields need only be objects — anything that came
 * off the wire as JSON already satisfies the value type.
 *
 * The result's own `ttlMs` and `cacheScope` are not checked either: the modern
 * schema declares them with `.catch(…)`, so a malformed value is replaced with a
 * default and can never fail validation. Checking them would be strictly stricter
 * than the client.
