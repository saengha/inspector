// Everything this module runs is untrusted PR code, so the tests are written
// around the two properties that make that safe rather than around happy-path
// plumbing:
//
//   1. the box's NETWORK IS NEVER TOUCHED after provisioning. It keeps the
//      platform baseline (public internet, private ranges denied) for its whole
//      life, so a server whose tools call an external API behaves the same
//      inside a check as anywhere else. The fake still EXPOSES `updateNetwork`
//      even though `CheckSandbox` no longer declares it, precisely so a
//      reintroduced lockdown would show up in the event log and fail a test
//      rather than pass unnoticed;
//   2. failures are attributed correctly — a broken build is the PR's
//      (`build_failed`), an unreachable E2B is ours (`infra_error`) — because
//      the attribution is what decides whether someone gets a red X.
