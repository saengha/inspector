/**
 * Per-credential ceiling on the routes that spend our egress dialling a
 * caller-named MCP server: `/servers/doctor` and `/servers/validate`, on both
 * `/api/web` and their `/v1` twins.
 *
 * WHY THESE TWO ROUTES HAVE THEIR OWN BUDGET. `guestRateLimitMiddleware` is the
 * only limiter on `/api/web/servers/*`, and it returns `next()` the moment
 * there is no `guestId` — so a signed-in caller was unmetered (finding MJ-012,
 * confirmed: forty consecutive requests, zero 429s). The `sk_` bucket inside
 * `bearerAuthMiddleware` meters an API key at 60/min, which is a budget for API
 * calls in general and not for outbound connections in particular.
 * `passthroughRateLimitMiddleware` meters per credential but is mounted only on
 * `/v1/*` and only for the one unverified class. None of that bounds "how much
 * of our egress may one caller spend", which is the quantity that made MJ-001's
 * port scan practical at scale.
 *
 * This is the doctor/validate slice of MJ-012, not MJ-012 itself: metering the
 * whole `/api/web/*` family is that finding's remediation and a much wider
 * blast radius.
 *
 * PER CREDENTIAL, WITH A PER-IP BACKSTOP — the split
 * `passthrough-rate-limit.ts` documents, for the reason it gives. A bearer
 * costs nothing to rotate, so a per-credential bucket alone brakes an honest
 * client and nobody else; the address is what rotated requests converge on. The
 * ordering below is load-bearing for the same reason it is there: a caller
 * already being refused must not be able to spend the budget it shares with
 * everyone behind the same NAT.
 *
 * SIZING. Measured rather than guessed. Hosted connect-shaped activity over the
 * 30 days to 2026-09-07 runs p50 1, p95 3, p99 5, observed maximum 10 per
 * person per five minutes, and per address the distribution is the same (max
 * 10, never more than two people behind one address). 20 is four times p99 and
 * twice the observed ceiling; 60 leaves room for a NAT far larger than any
 * we have seen. `/servers/doctor` has no first-party caller at all — not the
 * client, not the CLI, which runs the SDK doctor in-process — so there is no
 * in-product burst pattern these numbers could be cutting into.
 *
 * PER PROCESS, not per fleet. The windows live in this replica's memory, so a
 * horizontally scaled deployment enforces this per replica and the real ceiling
 * moves with the replica count. That is the same deliberate trade
 * `conformance-run-rate-limit.ts` and `passthrough-rate-limit.ts` document: it
 * blunts abuse rather than metering a product, and making it exact needs shared
 * state, not a smaller number.
 *
 * Local/desktop mode is exempt. `routes/web/**` is mounted there too, and the
 * one user is the person who started the process, dialling their own server.

 * that can end up in a heap dump has no business holding the value.
 *
 * An EMPTY bearer still gets a key, deliberately — the same hole
 * `passthrough-rate-limit.ts` closes from the other side. Treating "no
 * credential" as "no bucket" would let a caller skip the tighter budget by
 * sending no credential and spend only the shared per-IP window, which is the
