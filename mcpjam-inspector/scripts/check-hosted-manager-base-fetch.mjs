/**
 * Structural guard for pentest finding MJ-001.
 *
 * WHAT WENT WRONG, AND WHY A TEST WAS NOT ENOUGH. `MCPClientManager` falls back
 * to `globalThis.fetch` when neither the manager options nor the server config
 * carries a `baseFetch`, so a hosted manager built without one dials with no
 * address classification and follows redirects unchecked. Six construction
 * sites each decided that independently, and five of them decided nothing at
 * all — including the factory behind every `/api/web/*` MCP operation. The
 * runtime tests beside this script assert that today's factories carry a
 * guarded fetch; they cannot see a SEVENTH factory somebody adds next month.
 *
 * So this is the half that scales: hosted server code does not construct an
 * `MCPClientManager` at all. It calls a factory that always injects
 * `hostedMcpBaseFetch()`. A new construction site in a hosted directory fails
 * this check by existing, which is the point — the failure arrives at the
 * moment the decision is made, not the moment somebody audits it.
 *
 * SCOPE. Hosted server code only: `server/routes/web/**`,
 * `server/routes/v1/**`, `server/services/**`. Not `server/index.ts` or
 * `server/app.ts` — those are the LOCAL/desktop entrypoints, where reaching
 * `http://localhost:3000/mcp` is the entire product and the guard is
 * deliberately absent. Not `sdk/**` or `cli/**`, which are not this deployment.
 * Test files are exempt: a test asserting the unguarded behavior is legitimate.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT CATCH, stated so nobody reads more into a green run: it is a
 * source scan, so it sees `new MCPClientManager` and not a manager obtained by
 * other means, and it says nothing about whether the injected fetch actually
 * guards anything. That second property is the runtime test's job
 * (`server/utils/__tests__/hosted-mcp-base-fetch.test.ts`), and it asserts a
 * refusal rather than a non-null field for exactly this reason.
